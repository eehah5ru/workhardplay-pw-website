  / long description
  = capture_block_to long_descr=:long_descr do
    | By claiming the present, dance is always beyond its own work. In the very same moment as it takes place, dance is un-working. The difficulty to call it an art(work) can be traced historically, where it’s work is also its artwork: ergon is parergon, production is product. This separates dance from all other artforms.
    br
    br
    | This talk will trace what we can learn from an artform where the frame of the piece is under constant negotiation: economically, spatially and temporally. What does the history of dance say about the self-sustaining precarity of a contemporary body at work, today?
    br
    br
    | The talk will be held in english.

    | No one has ever enough time. Time is taken away from us by job that we love, is taken away by job that we hate, by one’s everyday functions and bad habits. For freeing our time we can reorganize everyday life or political reality, but situation can become so urgent that one have to get an injection of pure time here and now. Ilya Firdman, researcher of Idleness Research Institute, offers you a replacement therapy developed by him: you get a pill containing time and can dive into pure idleness for some minutes while the therapist taking over your time-robbing business.

    | Syringa is a recent performance work using voice, fragile touch and music. It is a delicate balancing act, fluttering on the blurry shift between interior and exterior positioning. Syringa is a disposition that listens to and learns from small sounds, repetitive operations, skipping records, self soothing hands, non-human rhythms and explosive sampling.

    | You don’t have to move at all, you can watch the pulses of the cerebral cortex. You can talk, sing, keep silent, dream, to be present here and now, there and then, inside and after. You can dance, of course, too. If you want.
    br

    | In performative-sound practice Helga proposes to stretch the concept of "disco" and move (or not move) guided by internal sensations from sound waves.

    | JOY: DATABASE OF DANCE MOVES FOR RAVE.
  / long description
  = capture_block_to long_descr=:long_descr do
    | This project is a production of acceleration. We understand acceleration as a ride with the wind in a burst of pure joy. During raves we don’t use other technologies except our own bodies and bodies of other people. We offer to ride on your body and on a strangers bodies for the production of pure joy. Each Teenage MUTANT NINJA TURTLE has its own type of weapon and methodology for this weapon, same way every dancer has his own best move for dancing and for body automatization.
    br
    br
    | Algorithm:
    br
    br
    | 1. Biohacking without surgery and medicine (except for doping): you can put on rollers and go (the body moves itself), you can implant the chip, and the door will open by itself. We suggest that you use someone else's movement and its repetition, hack the body.
    br
    br
    | 2. Pure joy is produced by repetition. Repetition of someone else's movement is like a machine  or a car that moves without purpose. When I repeat for you, my body moves itself. Your <b>dance moves</b> is my machine.
    br
    br
    | 3. The database will be presented in the form of a website on google server and in a form of a practice at a party/rave/social evening WH!PH!. Approximate time 1.5 hours.
    br
    br
    | Practice: first we dance of dance moves from the site's base, then everyone can offer their dance moves, which then we put into the database.
    br
    br
    | <b>Individual dance moves will be collectivized!</b>
