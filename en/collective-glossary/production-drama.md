The production drama is the affectivity unfolding in the context of (re)production and transformation of the regimes of work and leisure. PD was one of the sub-genres of socialist realism in literature and cinema, but it can also describe the deformation of mental, emotional and cognitive competencies under the influence of the productive forces of capitalism and post-socialism. The drama in PD emphasizes the dialectical couple of oppression and liberation in the context of (re)production.
