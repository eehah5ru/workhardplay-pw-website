Deprivatized, with a vector from the personal to the political, from Foucault to the xenofeminist manifesto. Postuling radical anti-essentialism and the maximum extended field of application of technology.  
  
What is interesting for us in them is the conjugation of the human with the inhuman. Reconstruction of the perception of oneself through the concept of an interface that would not be alienated. That would have been our comrade in navigation in the areas of reality, operating at different speeds.  
  
The way for this is a radical alienation, outlined in the xenofeminist manifesto, that starts from labor and through emotional labor comes to the human in general.  
  
Performative fictions and learning through living are practices that capture the field of meanings, previously occupied by adaption to the set conditions of someone else. They are a tool to separate oneself from the self-torturing logic of self-improvement and success.  
  
Here recursiveness is important for us, when none of the achieved states is finite and everything could be reconsidered.
