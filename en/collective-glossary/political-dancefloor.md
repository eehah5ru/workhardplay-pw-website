What political dimensions does the sound or the body moving on the dancefloor have? The affect generated by music and distributed in the space is the strongest tool of shared collectivity. “Gender of sound”* , material conditions of music production, depression after discoteque, night as queer-time, music and political protests, spoiled party and aural engagement: “political dance floor” invites to DJ sets, sessions of collective listening, performances, etc.

* The name of the research project of Сara Tolmie and Susanna Jablonski
