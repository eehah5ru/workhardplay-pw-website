Extractive capitalism is a form of capitalism that is based on the extraction of profit from humankind and nature as opposed to the modernist idea of productivity and mass consumption. The term is conceptualized by Saskia Sassen in her anthropological poem Expulsions, in which she describes how the second phase of capitalism leaves behind dead land and dead water through the extraction of palm oil, rare metals for electronics, diamonds and so on. This term helps us understand how contemporary capitalism works and bring the common denominator to various processes of extracting profits from the earth and from the body. EC is rather a gigantic mechanism for extracting value from humanity and nature, with the gradual exhaustion of all possible resources, including life, psycho and cognitive abilities and the biosphere. “Like potash fertilizers, human resources, their education and intelligence participate in the export of goods and services from Belarus (and other countries), operating on the same principle. Using the difference in the costs of resources and labour, transnational companies create a situation of exhaustion of the latter from a specific territory and communities. In one case – natural. In the second – intellectual and emotional. And yet, in our current climate, human capacities are stretched, treated as expendable and replaceable.”
