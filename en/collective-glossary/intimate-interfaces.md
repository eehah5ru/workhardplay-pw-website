Intimate interfaces are a border between the external and the internal, on which a micro effort of interaction takes place, minimal significance of these efforts allows a possibility of action (unlike impossibility of hyper effort) as well as tracking and redistribution of rationality. Supporting a format of transparency intimate interfaces track repressiveness and encourage reflexivity of the system for its preservation and for solidarity between objects outside common systems, in the universality of Reality. Intimate interfaces are a specific social connection between individuals, things, technologies, animals etc., which leads to a unique type of dependency between objects, which results in their certain intimate opening outside of subject-object relationships. Universality is Reality itself, in which objects "are situated" and which is confirmed by the Net (from social nets to animal internet). Universality contains different types of communities in itself (technologies-people, animal-people, different social groups of people), whose possibility of interaction can be provided by Intimate Interfaces.
