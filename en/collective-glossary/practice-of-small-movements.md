Practice of small (slow) movements is developed by Marina Russkikh, researcher at Delay Department of RI for doing nothing, as a way of counteraction to the culture of acceleration which is a characteristic of liquid modernity (Zygmunt Bauman). According to Bauman, new, or light; capitalism is characterized by elusiveness, detachment to material objects and commitment to high speeds.

People who move and act faster, who come nearest to the momentariness of movement, are now the people who rule. And it is the people who cannot move as quickly, and more conspicuously yet the category of people who cannot at will leave their place at all, who are ruled.
The contemporary battle of domination is waged between forces armed, respectively, with the weapons of acceleration and procrastination.

Artists, as well as other representatives of the classes exploited by the modern capital, live under constant oppression of a lack of time, they are often forced to work for maintenance at the works, which aren't connected with art, and they are constantly limited by many deadlines, that leads to nervous breakdowns, depressions and insomnias.

Practice of the small movements resists to the enslaving speeds of capitalistic oppression, seeking to approve the value of miniscule, minimal, slow.
Let yourself be slow. Feel the touch of air against the back of your palm. Hang inbetween.
