Mother-machine is a system created to support life and development of a human or animal embryo, created by human for human answering political, biological and psychological demands. Mother-machine politically frees a person from  the so called original sin, from suffering of child-bearing which are considered natural nowadays in order to control women and their bodies. It sets political borders between family and state as well as psychological borders between mother and child. Mother-machine is an operating name, as any person can have a baby, not only the one who defines themselves as a woman, and it means that mother is not an ideal definition. Mother-machine can't be defined as a total dismissal of human from nature, as it, as well as the human, is a product of natural evolution of living beings and their needs. At best it is a profanation of forced controlling institutions and practices, a triumph of self-knowledge and reflection.
