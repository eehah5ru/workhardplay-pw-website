Exploitation of hidden motivation. Each action has its own motivation. Also, traditionally artist this shares the impression, show his/her vision of the world or even create his/her own, the desire to share the pain, hatred and other negative and positive feelings. New critical practices contain various experiments based on idea and specific narratives. But there are a lot of hidden motivations, which only manifest themselves subconsciously. In my performance, I tried to use directly Nietzsche's "thirst for power" and force her to leave her "drawing", which my mind would not control. In many ways this subconscious desire moves a person to action, including the acquisition of knowledge, through which he expands his sphere of influence. It is curious that the game of points is popular precisely during lectures and lessons. Thus, students "bypass" the whole cycle of becoming, satisfying this hidden motive immediately.
