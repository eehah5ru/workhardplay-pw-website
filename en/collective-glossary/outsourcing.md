Source of precarity. It could be understood as a radical division of labor, driven by a desire to reduce production costs. This process is inextricably linked to the development of communication tools, which have allowed to reduce the cost of coordinating production dramatically, making possible complex supply and production chains, which adapt to market conditions.  
  
The term appeared in the 70’s, when the models of the division of labor that have existed in the enterprises producing goods, started to be transferred to the services sector. To the productions, which were not present in the commodity market, for example, management of enterprises, risks or logistics.  
  
What corporations promote as "sharing economies" is also outsourcing, but to an individual. In these models, such as, YouDo, Uber or Airbnb, corporations try to subordinate to this model almost all aspects of the business functioning: outsourcing almost all costs or expenses.  
  
Quoting "Platform Capitalism" by Nick Srnicek:  
"_Lean platforms operate through a hyper-outsourced model, whereby workers are outsourced, fixed capital is outsourced, maintenance costs are outsourced, and training is outsourced. All that remains is a bare extractive minimum – control over the platform that enables a monopoly rent to be gained._"
