The action takes place in the landscape, where the material for ideological constructions is plasterboard and banner fabric stretched over the frame for the press-wall. Where self-destructing new buildings coexist with (self)liquidating cultural institutions.

Planned self-destruction is a tool for competing uncertainty, an integral part of the strategy of unrestrained prototyping, appropriating areas that used to be similar to places of eternity arrangement.

Our question is how to survive, when someone is engaged in a planned self-destruction? How to expropriate the slogan of a startup culture “Fail fast and cheap. Fail often. Fail in a way that doesn't kill you”? How to learn manoeuvring between radical destruction and rebuild, when together with dropping back from our homes and dance floors we are looking for resources to create new ones.
