DESIRE. Capitalism simultaneously provokes new desires in us and imposes restrictions on their satisfaction. This condition leads to numerous neuroses and even schizophrenia. The ability of capitalism to generate new desires by any means was first noticed by Marx: "... and no eunuch flatters his despot more basely or uses more despicable means to stimulate his dulled capacity for pleasure in order to sneak a favor for himself than does the industrial eunuch – the producer – in order to sneak for himself a few pieces of silver, in order to charm the golden birds out of the pockets of his dearly beloved neighbors in Christ". (Economic & Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844).
