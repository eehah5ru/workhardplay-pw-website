Characteristics of the environment (optical, acoustic or other): transparency, fluidity, crystality, glassiness.

The places of fragility: shatters of the VDNKh, national library of Belarus, slepyanskaya water system, the institutions disappearing before your eyes, collective production as aesthetics, “Liner” restaurant at the National airport, skeletons of uncompleted hotels, under-utilised malls with deserted corridors and hollow boxes.

Transparent environments like new residential complexes, hotels, casinos, business centers, whose outlines and glass flesh are meant to signify modernity and economic growth; through the transparent bodies of which shine the skeletons of capital and corruption schemes; the dazzling glare of their surfaces does not allow to peer and hold the gaze, reflecting the ghostly piles of the (post-socialist) city, obscuring the places of memory. Transparency like exposure and possibility to see the inside.
