Extensions as add-ons; hybridity; improvements; deteriorations; tractions; expansions; cyborgization; disconnection of the body, collectivity, space. Extensions automate everyday life, they give the body new feelings, break the established and distribute collectivity. Do we want to be self-sustaining, self-motivating, self -repairing and replicating? Do we want to develop extensions of different levels? What is left by the board of biotechnology? Whether non-human queerness possible?
