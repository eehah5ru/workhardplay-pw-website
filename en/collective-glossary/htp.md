High-Tech Park is a special economic zone that has grown itself out of science campus. A place squeezed between a forest with ticks, museum of stones, institute for geophysics and the Minsk belt-road. It is an outsourcing plant, an incubator for profitable forms of collective knowledge production, a breeding-ground for inhuman imaginaries and forms of production of the future that could be characterized as the financially reliable "techno-determinism". The way how this lump is mounted to the rest of society is the source of dozens of painful effects, from "why am I not a programmer?" to "You know, Viber is a belarusian company!".
