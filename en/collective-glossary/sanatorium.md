1) From the socialist contemplation and regeneration of the body via the vaucher to exclusivity of health and post-Soviet rituals: in this way the development of sanatorium and health institutions in Eastern Europe could be described. WH!PH! wants to use the infrastructure of the post-Soviet sanatorium (oxygen cocktails and pearl baths) and to discuss rest, laziness and non-productivity, physical and mental health, illness and toxicity, physical and cognitive regeneration practices, pharma-industrial complex.

2) A novel topos of post-socialist curatorial imaginary that combines an impulse to revisit, a modernist architectural taste, left nostalgia, and collectivism.

If left museology aestheticized regional exhibition-making, then a will to curate sanatoria poeticizes past collective utopias reflected in architectures and orders of gone dispositifs of leisure.

By inserting into them current labor, ecological, therapeutic, bodily, athletic, and culinary concerns, the revisited sanatorium explores commonalities and shifts in the regimes of discipline and/or control characteristic of political economies and naturecultures of the historical socialism and the neoliberal present.
