The gift of deceleration, acting through the foretaste of irreversibility. Intoxication as the bursting of the everyday or as a rehearsal of the revolution at least. Muscles intoxicated by lactic acid during the training. Stress tests of collectives, dirty data and positive feedback loops in algorithmic systems, entropy of all kinds. The triumph of weak bodies, rejecting vitamins and stimulants, falling out of the deadlines grid and hourly contracts. Only the illness could prove to her with authority that she needs rest, opening the veil of long-desired. These desires-pulses were lightening the pain.
