term: tongue and teeth of creativity
author: Aleksei Borisionok

The language of creativity is being increasingly occupied by neoliberal logic and capitalist precarity. We hear more and more mantras of creativity: touch me, sense me, more requests for free volunteer work, while losing decent working conditions (were they good once?). What forms of criticism, self-organization, understanding of creativity can we use? Do we need to defend the concept of creativity or, re-using the title of the essay by Audre Lorde, “the master's tools will never dismantle the master’s house”? WH!PH! wants to discuss inventiveness ( izobretatel’nost ), criticism and exploitation through the creativity, history and practice of associations of cultural workers, forms of revitalization (gentrification?) and censorship, radical and collective creation. Can the sweet tongue of creativity hurt itself by a sharp tooth?
