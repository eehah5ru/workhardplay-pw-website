To be with everyone on a short leg, follow the tenderness of the corridors of your company, stimulate the imagination, do not let go of the thought, not for or against, but inside. Anomalies of the corridors. Mutations of relationships. Polyamory with a glowing screen. Emotion that does not have a home and does not belong to anyone, emotion that is inside a multitude of bodies. Nebulous collaborative work. Vague. Unclear. Foggy. Cloudy. Ghostly. Muddy. Cloudlike. Foggy-like.
