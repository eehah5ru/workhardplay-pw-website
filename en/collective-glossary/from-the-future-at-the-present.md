term: from the future at the present
author: Dzina Zhuk

Attempts to get out of stupor. Entering an uncomfortable zone that moves you beyond the notation of the problem. Aesthetics impaction which you would like to destroy. Broken transmissions. Imagination expansion question and its release from naturalized fixed forms. The construction of a new reality and collectivity within the familiar system of connections. Appropriation. Contextomy and reframing of the context. Collapsing of technological desires. Delight as a form of political. Provoking new forms of institutionalization. Falling and weaving time at different levels. Complexity of levels. Mismatches. Splitting time. Breakdowns of narrativization. You are always at the beginning and always at the end. Creating a utopia with a non-nostalgic view at the past or at the distant future. Creating a utopia of the present.
