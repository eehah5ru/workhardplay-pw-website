In CIS countries, a piece of land given by authorities to individual for recreational activities and the maintenance of ancillary farm. Obtaining such an object was necessarily preceded by the labor activity of the individual in the system of social production. The use of dachas provokes the individual to the circle reproduction of labor and recreation practices, where the function of recreation is provided by the preliminary work of the individual and persons invited by him from among relatives and friends who do not have dachas. Thus, the dacha becomes an instrument for managing the needs of the individual - if the individual doesn't want to become an asocial one, he/she must combine work and rest in the dacha's space - he/she can not choose only rest and remain integrated into the system of common dacha movement. Forced concentration of individual activity on development and usage of summer residence site solves for authority the issue of seasonal public leisure, but at the same time reduces the spectrum of individuals' interests only to problems of private property. Individual, absorbed in solving practical problems on maintaining of the object of private property, gives to it all his/her energy. He/she simply doesn't have enough time to express his political will and social reflection, . A person who needs to repair a leaking roof has no time to think about revolution.
