Object or an article of consumption. According to Baudrillard, "Apart from the uses to which we put them at any particular moment, objects in this sense have another aspect which is intimately bound up with the subject: no longer simply material bodies offering a certain resistance, they become mental precincts over which I hold sway, they become things of which I am the meaning, they become my property and my passion. "(The System of Objects, 2001). The object understood as passion is closely connected with such artistic and social phenomena as ready made and cargo-cult.
