1) Have you ever taken any substances to affect your condition while working or resting? What are the feelings associated with this experience: euphoria, depression, other strong or weak feelings? Describe how the perception of your own body and your motor functions changed before and after you took them. Describe how you felt inside a group of people before and after taking the stimulant. We invite you to take a closer look at your neuroses, diseases and pleasures that you share with others, through which you socialize, and those, which, on the contrary, push you out of groups. Do they correspond to the contemporary capitalist formation? What substances nourish / suppress them? What is their pharmacodynamics?

2) A set of prescriptions, notations, bodies and movements encompassing relations and substances that create and sustain affects. Pharmachoreography spans a mise en sc√®ne that telescopes from moleclar neurotransmitters to the intersubjective to the planetary social political economy of epistemes, productive forces, relations, and logistical supply chains of substances of affect.
