Joy Acceleration is an acceleration, understood as the / equivalent expression "to ride with the wind with pure joy." Joy Acceleration does not pursue any pragmatic goal, except pure joy, which is performed by repetition. The time delay between zero speed and fifth speed is equal to a click of fingers. Automation of the body due to the repetition of the corona movement of someone else's body or structure is possible. Do it. Joy Acceleration can be done on a rave (riding on the movements of someone else's body) or in a dance (riding on the wheel collectivity).
