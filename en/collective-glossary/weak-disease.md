Inside the disease itself, the psycho-pharmacological aspects of late capitalism are not obvious: behind the pill of ibuprofen, which brings little comfort, the chains of production and distribution of pharmaceutical drugs, privatisation of knowledge and resources, relations of “the north” and “the south”, normalisation of pain in a female body and mechanisms of desubjectivation are compressed. A weak disease is the disalignment of collective and individual time of rest and work, inaction, burnout. It is more symptomatic for late capitalism. In a precarious economy illness is not protected with a sick leave or a sanatorium, what trade unions and organised workers’ parties struggled for. In this case illness is the unexpended cost of working time, biopolitical diffusion of power.
