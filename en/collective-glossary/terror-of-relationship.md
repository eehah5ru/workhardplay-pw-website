Terror of the non-blood relationship is a practice of re-coding simultaneously directed inside and outside of the collective, subject, community or network. It is a symbolic gesture that speculatively unfolds from the future and acquires its materiality through the performance of the collective.

When unfolded inward, it is the answer to the question of how to saddle the corporate “we” so that after being fired it would be not so intolerably painful (practice of “de-we-fication”). At the same time a non-blood relationship is an antidote to the professional failure that turns into the personal insult. It comes into light in a situation where friendly networks are intertwined with professional ones, when affectivity is our means of production.

When unfolded outward, it is the way to embody the desires, the immobilization of the enemy by a sister kiss. This is the opacity of transparency regimes that pierce us.
