Psychogeography of data – phychodata – which is very subjective and connected to an individuality of each of us. Files with texts, photos, letters to a friend, whom you haven’t been writing for ages. GPS-tracks of the only one running last summer. A worddoc of a friend, which she asked you to print. 1642 files in a folder called “to_sort_out” on your desktop. Part of those files belong to you, leave an imprint after you, they do tell at least something about you, those endless data flows. Data are instruments of communication between us, means of learning, resources for enjoyment, tools of life producing. What kind of relationships can enter our data in and what is their class affiliation?
