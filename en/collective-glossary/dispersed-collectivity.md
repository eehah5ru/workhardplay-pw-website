We revolt against the complex, confused, trans- networks of exploitation of modern economic and political systems, by generating virtual comradely connections, conspiratorial attachments, producing precarious solidarity and flickering collaboration. New materialisms awaken the unpredictability and complexity of new constellations of bodies and subjectivities. Shimmering presence and absence of bodies. Instead of nostalgia for imaginary communities there are dynamic links and networks, the instability of our borders, virtual collectivity. We act through co-presence, movement, text, attraction, dissolution, podcast, pulsating intensity, out of sight, slipping, viewing, takeover, vnenakhodimost.
