term: national academy of sciences as witch

In the era of universal rationalization the National Academy of Sciences produces collective knowledge, whose production methods are soup from bureaucracy, market reforms, the Soviet legacy, science, understood as “satisfaction of one's own curiosity at the state expense” and purely administrative and economic activities. WHPH offers to recode this place in the very city center, referring to it as something that brings us healing, where neoliberal norms of human rights are suspended, where one can smoke at the corridors, and and you can see the reflection of steam from the boiler in the wrinkles of an academician — a collective dinosaur looking at us from the billboard — in which he cooks his formulations. There is a museum of achievements, satellites on a red carpet; they produce wine and a “formula of tranquility” — tablets “tryptophan”. It is a witch house, free from the pressure of society.
