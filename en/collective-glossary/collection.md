COLLECTION as a form of enrichment. According to Luc Boltanski and Arnaud Esquerre (Enrichissement, Une critique de la marchandise, 2017), the creation of collections is a new way of producing surplus value in contemporary capitalism. "Classic" capitalism extracts surplus value by reducing the costs associated with production and, in particular, by reducing the wages of workers. However, today in post-industrial societies, surplus value is created through the transformation of everyday objects in the rank of collectibles. This effect is achieved with the help of storytelling, bringing objects closer to folk craft, works of art and cultural heritage.
