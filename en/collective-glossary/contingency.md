Quoting Yoel Regev, encountering a coincidence in our everyday experience, _"we react ... trying to imagine one of its poles as non-real and the result of our inadequate knowledge of reality, while this deficiency can have both deducting and augmenting character: the connection actually exists, but we do not know its origin; or the connection does not really exist, and it is just us who bring it into reality ("it only seems to us")".Â _  
  
Contingency is the situation of insisting on the independence of the coincidence itself, its irreducibility to any logical order, the disclosure of its potential as a _"center of active resistance" (Regev)_. The subject of this situation is free from the need to alienate one's energy, trying to reduce the coincidence to the familiar order of things.  
  
Contingency is emancipation.
