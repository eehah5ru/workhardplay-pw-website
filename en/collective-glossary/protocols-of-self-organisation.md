Protocols are formed as systems of rules. However, this model is not immutable. To the contrary, it is intrinsically multilayered, the system of rules could be re-established and redesigned. There are affects, emotions, attractions and neuroses that invisibly or visibly grow in the process of acting out those sets of rules. Protocols as scenarios, procedures or algorithms, as a formalisation of certain logics and operations. Along with their flexibility. What is to be controlled and programed and what to be kept spontaneous or “unsafe”: failures and breakages, transparent zones and blind spots, open and “closed” calls, emotional and political relations, desires and discipline?
