A trace, an imprint, a dent noticed on your body in the morning, a hickey, the lipstick stuck in the dry lipsâ€™ skin, buzzing of the muscles, ringing in the ears, the hangover dizziness, a blurry stamp or a stroke of the marker on the wrist, recently deleted files, conspiratorial connections, disturbing images, echo of pleasure. Sliding between the embodied experience and representation, affect and language, the event and its mediation. The embodied imaginary of another (utopian) space. Melancholy for time, when intensity and transcendence were possible, longing for the Event that still had transforming power, phantom collectivity.
