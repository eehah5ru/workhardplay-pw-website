COINCIDÁNCE— spontaneous emergence of overlapping probability spaces between independent event trajectories that violates the causality principle. Presumably, this is an effect of the material-semiotic entanglement of matter that is substantially based on a dynamic probability distribution. Given that the concept of probability inevitably refers to the sensory cognition and to the experience of confidence/doubt in the truth of a judgment (the etymology of the term leads to the Latin probare —"to try”, “to test”), Coincidánce can be recognized as such only from within the cognitive state of involvement into the event series intersection.
As a result, the frequency of Coincidánces can be significantly increased by means of special rituals and practices that change cognitive states.
For example, divinations, conjurations, channeling, various fortunetelling procedures are aimed at creating conditions that significantly increase the likelihood of a Coincidánce. Unusual series of Coincidánces can occur in states of heuristic affect, insight, scientific discovery, poetic inspiration, as well as epiphanies of various etiologies. Understood in a broad sense — as a quasi-determination of improbability — Coincidence lies at the basis of nonlinear autopoietic (Varela, Maturana) or sympoietic (Haraway) emergent processes, such as evolution, history, biography, etc.
Philosophical and political implications of Coincidánce are the subject of study of coincidence philosophy (Regev).
