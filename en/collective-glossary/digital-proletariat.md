Workers of digital forms of employment. The proletariat of the digital age. Those who are on the submarines of the computer industry. Those who keep the secrets of large companies and beginning startups. Those who are in the digital islands of isolation. Those who can easily be replaced, a badge could be thrown away and forgotten. This is an invisible pool of human labor, ensuring the functioning of digital infrastructure.
