Mutro Art group was found in 2010 by two artists - Timothy Maxymenko and Vano Sai - but each time collaborates with new artists. Group works in the field of contemporary art in different media such as performance, new media art. Our artistic practice is related to different topics and contexts from experiments with language and word itself, performative interactions in public to works which question such matters as relativity of time and space, metamorphosis of information and a role of modern human in the world.
