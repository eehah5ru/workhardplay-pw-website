After studying Mathematics and Physics, Virgile Novarina (born in France in 1976) devoted himself to the artistic exploration of his own sleep through writings and drawings, and the sleep of others through photographs and films. He has published seven books of Night’s Writings and Drawings, and has exhibited his work in France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, Poland and the United States. Since 2006 the very act of sleeping has become an integral part of his work, through the “En Somme” series of performances, during which he sleeps publicly in shop windows, galleries or museums.

In 2002 Virgile Novarina befriended the painter Jean-Olivier Hucleux, whom he regularly filmed from 2005 to 2009. "Jean Olivier Hucleux, from the work to the artwork" (60', 2012, a.p.r.e.s production) is his first documentary. Previously he made "Around sleep" (2004, 12 min.), a short film unfolding on the course of one day whose only characters are sleepers and yawners. In 2016 he directed "Deep into Sleep" (39', a.p.r.e.s Production), a literary and philosophical descent into various sleep states, with Michel Butor, Clément Rosset, Pierre Pachet, and Jean-Luc Nancy. His last film, "Inner Telescope, a Space Artwork by Eduardo Kac" (35', Observatoire de l'Espace, 2017) takes us in a journey from earth towards the International Space Station for the creation of the first spatial poem conceived by Kac for weightlessness...
