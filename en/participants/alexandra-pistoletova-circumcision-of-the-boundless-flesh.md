Alexandra Abakshina with Alina Shklyarskaya created the Post - anatomy theatre Maailmanloppu https://www.facebook.com/manloppu/

We call ourselves the radical branch of modern theater. We are interested in practical transdisciplinarity.

Post- anatomy project theater MAAILMANLOPPU - forms mobile alliances, creative groups, integrates various types of knowledge and practices to study the phenomena of modern reality. The authors argue that only modern theatrical practices can present a phenomenon (including a scientific one) in the form of real experience. The group's artistic practice is a situation of shame (crude style), an emergency situation, abandoning the image, preferring the literal to provoke the spectator's view / hearing, without involving.
