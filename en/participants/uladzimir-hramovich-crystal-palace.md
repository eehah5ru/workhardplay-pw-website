Uladzimir Hramovich is exploring the development and the influence of the ideology and social transformation on “the matter” in his works: whether it is in lithography, historical documents and in the city’s structure. He is interested in the stuck of the memory in the copies and reproductions between freshly paved stone blocks, where there is no more any “aura” but there is something which is absent in the original.
