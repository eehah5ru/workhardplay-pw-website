The main artistic strategy of Anastasya Kizilova is creation of the open research field for interaction and communication.  Artists’ projects dedicated mainly to the questions of air-tightness of art society and its’ autonomy. One of the goal of her projects is to implement into Russian and international art scenes alternative economic models. She is often trying to initiate processes which is never going to end, to create communication structures which can exist without her and to research human borders and borders of an art community (for example, through reading groups with plants participants). Since 2013 she is sewing identical uniforms for artists (even for those who are in the conflict between each other), constantly positioning herself in the art field as an art worker. Since 2016 she collects "Found Project", archive of the unrealized art ideas which authors share gratuitously and anonymously with everyone to take the idea on realization.
