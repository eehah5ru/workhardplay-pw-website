Create a fire, physically, sonically, digitally – concentrate on the fire, ask it a question in your head and let it reveal the answer to you, don't try too hard just let it talk and you listen. If keywords or phrases come up, say them out loud. You can do this activity alone or in a group, speaking aloud will be heard by the whole group and the fire knows this, so don't be shy to pass on its messages. UNLOCK THE LUCID HARDWARE.
