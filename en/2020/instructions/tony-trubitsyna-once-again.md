0\. think of a period of time.

0.4. How long does it take you to come when you masturbate?

How many minutes do you need to get out of bed in the morning?

How many hours do you write a poem or look out the window, or decide to come up to speak with someone?

How many seconds do you talk on the phone with mom and grandmother?

How many moments would you like your orgasm to last?

How long would you like to lie in the bathroom and in the sun?

How many minutes do you eat a bowl of soup?

How long does your talk about breaking up last?

How much do you understand that you no longer love? And when do you forget / forgive the insult?

How much time do you need to notice that you are offended?

How much time passes before you can take a person by the hand? And trust him?

How long have you been eating ice cream?

How long did your shortest love last? How many times during this time would you have time to flip through a feed on instagram?

1.3. Take one of the above or select yours slot of time.

2.1. Determine the exact length of time during which you made the selected action or inaction (for this you can do it with a stopwatch or restore it in memory by calendar, diary, email or instant messengers).

2.9. Set yourself reminders on your phone. Live an hour at these intervals (if your slot is up to 15 minutes) or a day if more than an hour. If you want to live a longer period, put a reminder on the day and current time, sign what this reminder is about. You can mark this period, both in the future and in the past.

3.2. Live one period of time different from usual minutes and seconds.

4.1. Share what exactly you have lived and by which slots in any way convenient for you with the hashtag [#ещеразок]{.shiny} [#onceagain]{.shiny} or in tour [specially made chat in Discord](https://discord.gg/7EBvdw2){target="_blank"}.
