1st part / individual practice


✍ We make about 30-40 sheets with gestures. Gestures are best to be dictated by someone. No more than 10 seconds for each gesture.


**Suggested Order :**

1. start with the same type of gestures (eg. Make sharp horizontal lines; draw
one curved diagonal line without taking your hands off; a series of thin circles, etc.)

2. alternate different gestures on one sheet (eg. First, a series of small
spots, then dots)

3. drawn one shape, but stress its character at most ( a big circle / roundness, balance; vertical / aspiration up; triangle / sharpness, angularity; fluff / tenderness, weightlessness; square / thoroughness, heaviness; ornate line / flexibility, pattern, etc.)

4. convey the state in abstract forms (chaos / confusion, ecstasy / happiness,
peace / balance, sadness, playfulness, etc.)

5. trying to write down the text under a quick dictation, helps to show the form of the handwriting itself.

6. draw free associations on one specific image, a fragment of text

**Types of gestures and forms for analysis:**

* By strength and flexibility: sharp / smooth, rough / tender;
* By time: short / long, continuous / continuous;
* By degree of pressure: light / heavy, strong / weak;
* By direction: vertical / horizontal / diagonal
* Angularity: sharp / round, straight / curved
* By thickness: thick / thin;
* By textire: rough / smooth.

**Important!** 

Go from the drawing process itself, following the emotional impulses, hand and body movement, not from an idea or image. Try to work at a pre-rational, non-conceptual level.

Gestures can be evaluated later based on an analysis of form or mood. Remove everything that seems redundant at the moment (but do not throw it away). Leave 10-15 sheets, make several compositions. Focus on the three most successful. Such reduction helps to get rid of all unnecessary, being faithful only to the most important and relevant now.

All sheets with gestures can be saved and periodically used. For example, start the day by laying out new songs.

**⚑  Purpose of practice:**

Find your personal forms, psychophysical traces, gestures using automatic writing. Create an abstract series from them. Important to go from a process, and not from an idea, to its form through practice, and only after analyzing / realizing it.
This practice is an attempt to come through clouded and "random" to situational clarity.

Position yourself in a mobile adequacy to the current moment.

✄ Material: ink, A4 sheets, brushes of different sizes and shapes.

2 part / collective anarchist practice

✍ In the continuation, I propose a collective variation of the first score.

Prepare places, preferably rounded, for 5-6 people.
Sit together in a round dance. Take sheets a3 / a4 and markers (pencils,
color marks). Leave traces / gestures / signs on the sheets, then pass them around in circles.

Examples of algorithms: ➔ draw with the hands of neighbors (your neighbor draws your hand accordingly) ➔ draw, conducting a delusional monologue (a difficult task of connecting verbal and motor activities) ➔ draw, simultaneously conduct subversive activities (scream phrases / slogans / appeals, in every possible way ideologically and physically distracting other painters) ➔ draw with your left hand, interfering with your right hand or helping a neighbor ➔ draw by a specific count, for example, transfer sheets one / two / three ➔ draw for an arbitrary, unassigned account (the painter is not able to predict when time will end) ➔ and so on.

You can create a panel from the resulting pictures.

Gestures are best done under the dictation of the other. No more than 10 seconds for each gesture.

**⚑ Practice goal:**

1. Playing a situation of collective creativity, when consensus, impulse and inspiring unity, are followed by controversy or even dissensus. And the final the result of creativity is poorly imaginable and optional;

2. Training personal resistance to external stimuli;

3. Training subversive / annoying activity.

✄ Material: felt-tip pens, markers sheets A4 / A3.
