Begin with [reading this](http://homepages.herts.ac.uk/~comqcln/HarawayCyborg.html): read the 1st paragraph, then from the 7th to the 13th paragraph and finally the last paragraph ending with "Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our tools to ourselves. This is a different dream of a common language. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, spaces, stories. I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess." Take a break after reading. Now think about what you have read; Read it again if you want; Search the web about its author Donna Haraway. She wrote this in 1983! Think about what this could mean for your situation in 2020. Do you feel like a cyborg? Haraway says we are all cyborgs. What would we need to do to design and change ourselves as we want us to be and not merely buy technologies others control and own? How can we make our own cyborgian parts our own social networks in order to rave and rage against fake news, unwanted surveillance, algorithmic despotism? How could we get out of our echo chambers and filter bubbles and meet different persons, new and exciting things? Becoming cyborgian means in my opinion not  escaping the system, but to work with-in the system. Send me an email with some answers if you like >> algorhythmicmachine AT googlemail DOT com
