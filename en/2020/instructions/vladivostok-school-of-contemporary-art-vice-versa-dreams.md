During the week, record all your dreams and add them to the groupâ€™s general dream diary. Trying to live a dream in the opposite way. Your dream or a dream of your mate.
To observe how an attempt to live non-being from the past distorts the time in the present.
Try collective dreams. Dream notebook link: https://pad.riseup.net/p/Vice_versa_dreams
