Write me a letter (daria.yurychuk@gmail.com), and I will answer you. Tell me what you care about, how you feel, whether you have enough money, what idea came to your mind, what you are afraid of. Tell me how you meet new people, do you write letters to them, do you look in their eyes, how do you reveal your interest, if you like someone, are you afraid to write to strangers?
