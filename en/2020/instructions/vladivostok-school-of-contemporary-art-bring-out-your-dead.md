Offer the group individual formats for getting rid of obsessive thoughts: breathing practices, hypnosis, confession. Practice the methods that will be offered to you. Stop at the one that helped you most to take a fresh look at your inner “lice” and love them.


Make a collage herbarium of your triggers, anxieties, intolerances.


Bake pastries or bread daily for a week, condemning the dough to your “weaknesses”, traits of your character that “interfere” with your kin. Feed the pastries to the pigeons, leave the bread on the sidelines.


Shave baldly, do it slowly, speaking your “disadvantages”, take them and shave them off at the same time.


Sew in the clothes that you most often wear a white thread, at least 30 cm long. Think about your past losses and failures when you sew it. Iron these stitches each time you wear this garment. Feel your skin through this line of sewn thread. Get rid of your clothes as soon as you are ready to get rid of your inner “lice”.


Drink a course of pills removing worms from your body.
