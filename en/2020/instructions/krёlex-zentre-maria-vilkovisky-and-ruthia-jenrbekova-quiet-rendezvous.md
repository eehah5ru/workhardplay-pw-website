Choose a person_s / creature_s with whom you would like to, but cannot meet (now), because she / he / they are either no longer (or not yet) here in our (physical, terrestrial) world. Make an imaginary date with her / them in a quiet secluded place, best in a park, on a bench, by the river, etc. To do this, write him / them a note indicating the time and place, make a paper airplane out of the note and let it fly out of the window or from the bridge or from wherever in any direction. Your vis-à-vis must have at least three days / nights left in order to prepare for the meeting. Come to the appointed place in time. Bring any small gift with you — a candy, a drawing, a flower, a bead — whatever. Spend with your vis-à-vis at least quarter of an hour or more. Feel the co-presence. Talk. Tell / ask them out loud about something. Listen to her / their possible cues / responses or other reactions (air movement?). Try to utter (repeat) aloud the most clear of his / her / their remarks / thoughts / reactions to make sure that you have (not) understood them properly. When you feel like wrapping up the meeting, tell her / them about it. Please ask before leaving whether he / they enjoyed the meeting. Thank her / them for being with you. Leave your gift at the meeting place, while mentioning whom exactly it is for.
