Find a calm place to listen to the audio. Make sure that there is no background noise. Get a pair of headphones and plug them into your listening device; it’s important to experience the piece in full. Close your eyes and focus only on [what you hear](https://soundcloud.com/user-357926338/asmrgifts/s-tPLVPLNLkdA).
