In English. NO TIME is a sound and text performance by Sanna Samuelsson, based on found text in her own laptop, both written by her and from random pdf’s. Fluttering between fragments of manure and decomposing bodies, to the image of Marie Antoinette’s mock farm The Hameau de la Reine burning during the revolution, the performance explores connections between the supposed standstill of the pastoral landscape, with the capitalist notion of certain places as irrevocably irrelevant.
