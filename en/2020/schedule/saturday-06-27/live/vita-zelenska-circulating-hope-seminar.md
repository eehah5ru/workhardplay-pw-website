Sounds or words  


How do slow hopes operate us these days, how does waiting creates our online tracks and routes? Slow down is often presented as the hope of new ecological and more attentive to inequalities futures, but how the slowdown is performed as hope for nothing? New pointless rounds are rounds of hope betrayed are plays of hope for nothing, the hope of hope’s nonexistent.  


Writing together a poetry letter that goes round and round, round a clock we could say, the clock that works for nothing.  


Expressing our pointless erotical love for plants that can’t touch us, plants-for-nothing, hopelessness - a matter of future, up and down, greens and to the Earth.  


Circulation of hope which entails hopelessness is overwhelming and can be put in a far-away sound of losing that is sound of loosening and tightening again as if gathering yourself for wholesome hope, that would make us sick and back again to the promising hope for nothing.
