Over a certain period, we will dance, according to pre-prepared instructions. We will move outwardly asynchronously, as one body, and inside ourselves - synchronously. In this way we can be at a timeless point and explore the space around us and our thoughts and feelings about it. 

Everyone can join the dance. To do this, use the instructions.


Can a dance be timeless? How human body feel during the dance? Do we own our body during the dance? Who or what does it belong to? At what time point is it located? Can we, while dancing, exist simultaneously in the past, present and future? Time is always about synchronism and asynchrony. Asynchrony is a mismatch in time. Is it possible to assume that asynchronous dance is timeless? We are sure that it is.
