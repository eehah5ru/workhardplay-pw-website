everything seems so far away these days. we are so far away from each other. let me invite you on this zoom walk which might bring all things closer. as close as possible. on the agreed day at agreed time we all start walking wherever we are. once you want to take a photo of something to share, do that on your phone camera with the maximum zoom only and send to the group. letâ€™s bring it close.

participants should have a mobile device with internet connection and possibility of sending photos via WhatsApp. [Link to the WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/J5t73T2LBhNKloe4x2yOG1)
