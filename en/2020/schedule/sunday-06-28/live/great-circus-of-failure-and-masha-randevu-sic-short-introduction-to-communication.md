**GRR (General Rules of Randevu):**

Participants agree on the time of ‘Randevu’

Participants get acquainted with the score and invite guests

Guests are not acquainted with the score

One of the participants creates a group call in Skype

‘Randevu’ starts when all participants are present in a group call

It is advised to turn off the microphone and camera at the beginning of Randevu and to turn them on in the moment when you want to join the event

Guests can leave and return to ‘Randevu’ during the process

Guests can react to events and join them, but it is not required

‘Randevu’ ends at the expiration of the score

**RRP (‘Randevu’ Rules for the Participants):**

For the each participant, active intervals alternate with the passive ones

The participant chooses by him-/herself which one to start with

The duration of the time intervals can be measured by internal sense

For each interval, the participant selects a random object (*) from the environment and interacts with it by use of the available Skype tools: sound, video, photos, text messages, screen translation Interaction tools should differ in the adjacent intervals of activity

* By an object is understood either a thing (i.e. the teapot) or a large entity (i.e. the street) or an abstraction (i.e. internal sense)

In such a way the participant broadcasts the selected object to all the others, who are present at ‘Randevu’

Non-verbal broadcasting is recommended

It is advised to pay attention to the activity of other ‘Randevu’ participants and use the reaction in your own activity”
