title: "TUESDAY / JUNE 23"
---

Today we call you to follow the instructions ~ scores ~ exercises as a practice of dispersed collectivity — as an attempt to live this day together at a distance. There is no exact schedule for this day — the schedule is self-organized in a collective chat where you can lure others into joint practice and share your performance experience.
