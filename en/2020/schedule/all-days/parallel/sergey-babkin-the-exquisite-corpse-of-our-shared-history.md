Temporalities happen to crystalize in histories, while histories are constantly revised. But when post- had not yet happened, it seemed that the source of the revisionism is concentrated enough to revise history in a centralized way, according to the logics of the bipolar world and party intrigues. In the condition of post- the total revisionism of our shared history that seemed so necessary:
1)          Turned out to be provided by a lot more agents than earlier, still not accountable to anyone or anything besides their own interests; 2) Turned out to function according to the logic of (financial) markets and the speed of high-frequency trading; 3) Found itself in a quantum state of simultaneous production of not-/semi-/still/despite-everything-connected narratives; 4) Gained a new form of being public, that has a lot to do with functions of commenting and editing.
Even though an act of microrevisionism is produced after each time the button Send is clicked (either by an activist or by an employee of the Troll Factory), it seems that a central public territory of the History Revisionism appeared – the Wikipedia. It was created as a promise of a peer-review approach to the written knowledge but became a territory of the Battle of Corrections.  This overlapping of corrections has something to do with the surrealist practices of juxtapositions, accumulations, doublings and searching for lower layers while looking at the upper ones. The game The Exquisite Corpse of Our Shared History is based on the game The Exquisite Corpse but uses found content and e-mails. The game should satisfy the desire for new historical revisionisms that are intrinsic to our dynamic subjectivities, power up the disintegration of micronarratives — through the anonymous collectivity of the chain of e-mails, provoke the fact-checking instincts in their interaction with a vice of trust to anything anonymous. What would motivate you in reinterpreting history: sense of justice? The claim to comply with the cause-effect principle? The urge to provoke people around you?
During the game you will receive an e-mail with a text of a Wikipedia article about a historical event you might be acquainted with. You can change one sentence in it, but don’t make it visible. Then you send the text to the next player who does the same. In the final, the results of a collective anonymous act of revisionism will be published online.
