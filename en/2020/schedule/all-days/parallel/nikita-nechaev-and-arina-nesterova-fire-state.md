“Why not assume in this case, that thought is precisely that most qualitatively peak form in which is realized the accumulation and productive use of energy, emitted by the suns?


That is, this same link which as yet is lacking, in order for an actual big circle to be possible, and not a one-sided and irrevocable process of dispersal of matter and motion in intergalactic space?”


Instruction-game, made in the form of a script in Twine. Algorithms of movement executed in different contexts, are accompanied by audio. Instruction, script and a plot lives in a tension between the abstract and the concrete. Based on a method of ascension from the abstract to the concrete by Ilyenkov, we are offering the participant to move away / approach the objective and evaluate the role of the instruction as an ally or distracting interlocutor, explore the excesses of rational production, raptures of “techno-naturalistic isomorphism”.
