We invite you to play the counter-detective game Pokemon-D, in which participants who are deprived of real names are divided into teams, inside of which they must RECOGNIZE each other. Yes, there are no those who are hiding, no fugitives — there are only those who are desperate to reveal their identity. Which would be simple if they could communicate directly.


But they do not have such a possibility. Counter-detectives use the Pokemon Go game interface to communicate.


1. Install Pokemon Go app to your phone. Create an account with a FAKE NAME/NICKNAME. Don’t connect it to your Facebook page!!

2. After initial training, click on your avatar and go the FRIENDS section, then +ADD FRIEND. Send your friend code to game bot  in Telegram @PokemonD_bot (still don’t connect to Facebook!).

3. The friend feature in Pokemon Go allows gamers to send ONE GIFT per DAY to each other. Gifts contain postcards - PHOTOS AND NAMES OF REAL PLACES - that is the only personal information that can be transmitted through Pokemon Go.

4. LET’S GO!!! The admin responds you with a list of 5 names of WHPH participants and 5 friend codes. Now your detective job is to IDENTIFY each other - connect PokeTrainers to WHPH participants. The only accessible information is the locations that they visit, which the GIFT system provides. To do your detective job you can use all external resources (Google, social networks etc) - there are no limitations (excluding asking your real friends what are their nicknames in the game of course ..).

5. Look careful on the information about your visiting spots that you provide by GIFTS! The group of players forms a UNIT - you need to BE IDENTIFIED as well as DOING identification. The UNIT with the greatest identified number of participants wins.

6. LET’S GO!! You have only time before the closing-game event on WHPH week to do the job.


The game takes ~ 30 minutes to install and 10 minutes every day.
