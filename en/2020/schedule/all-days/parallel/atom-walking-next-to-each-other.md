We are now walking next to each other, each of us recording this journey for two of you. Both of you will be far, yet you will be able to walk this route together, listening to it at the same time, hearing the footsteps of a stranger next to you, walking in between the real and the imaginary. Who knows, at the end of the walk you might want to have a talk with each other.


To take part please fill in the google form before 23:59 June 28 and we will find you a walking partner.
