We are now walking next to each other, each of us recording this journey for two of you. Both of you will be far, yet you will be able to walk this route together, listening to it at the same time, hearing the footsteps of a stranger next to you, walking in between the real and the imaginary. Who knows, at the end of the walk you might want to have a talk with each other.

To take part please fill in the google form and we will find you a walking partner.

to take part you would need a smartphone with the WhatsApp application installed, internet access and headphones. you can be anywhere, but it should allow you to listen to the soundtrack.
