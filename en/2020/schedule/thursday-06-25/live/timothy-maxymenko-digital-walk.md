“I invite everyone to participate in a collective digital walk which will be a created online space with many different paths and portals that will use hyperlinks to move from one to another. At some point, those wandering in hyperspace will be able to intersect and diverge in the same way. Something is open access but something is private, somewhere you can add and leave a message and somewhere just pass through. Privacy settings will determine the texture and materiality of the spaces. 🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗
