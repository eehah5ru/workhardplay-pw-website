I feel burned out from the self-imposed (and fake) necessity to come up with wholesome, conceptual, academically valid projects. So I would like to try some amateur autoethnography instead - autoethnography of Google Chrome, saved pages in Facebook and other tools of digital forgetfulness. In the last 4 years while I was writing my PhD project I kept saving - and never opening again - various urls. I think now is a good time to open them. What will we see? I don’t know, but I’m curious. At the moment of writing this proposal, I still haven’t opened them, so I’m not even sure what exactly I’m proposing. I’m curious what I will consider worthy of public discussion or not. How secretive will I feel about sharing my ideas and interests? What was I interested in, in the first place? What consoled me? What upset me? What did I want to remember (and couldn’t)? What would Aby Warburg say about this? Or Marianne Hirsch? What gave me joy? What rooms did I enter and got scared? I would like to be scared again. 

**Will be held in Russian and English.**
