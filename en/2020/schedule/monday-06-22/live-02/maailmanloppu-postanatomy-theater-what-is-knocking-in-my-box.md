They are knocking  in a box. They want your attention and we will give it to them in the format of art mediation of  boxes.

In this project, it is interesting for us to test such a state as carelessness from ignorance and  willingness to receive the most diverse, designating, re-designating, evaluating or re-evaluating/overestimating  stuff. This practice gives the possibility  to face  a miracle: you can get something  you did not know existed. Or,  it’s something that didn't exist before but here you are -  you take it from  the box

We made jewellery film with toys hat rattle in the box (originally they were made as decorations, but all of them were unfinished, because they are good as they are) . Labels are sewn to the images of toys in the Google document. We combined everything into art mediation. You will see screen with quick iMessenger. We do not use messenger app for communication but as a window / canvas / box where we place the text for art- mediation.

We want to turn everything upside down and shake it up!

**The play/art meditation will be in Russian and English.**
