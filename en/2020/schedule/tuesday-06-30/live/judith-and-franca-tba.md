Late Socialism in Germany was the time of awakening of lesbian-feminist potentialities. During the few and long months when everything seemed uncertain and possible, groups of (lesbian) women gathered in all GDR-towns to redefine their place in society. Few months later, their new-found voice was drowned in the noise of neoliberal chit-chatting. But when we listen closely, their agitated, angry, loving voices still resonate in us. 

We want to examine the queerfeminist potentialities of late socialism, letting its dreams and ideas slip through broken time into our realities, connect to past present and examine our present past. What has been there all the time? What was lost on the way? Time to re-connect.
