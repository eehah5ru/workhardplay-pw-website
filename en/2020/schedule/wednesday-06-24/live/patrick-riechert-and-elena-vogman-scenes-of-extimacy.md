This exercise poses the question of intimacy from the perspective of the machinic. Coming back to Guattari and Deleuze’s notion of machines, we aim at excavating one of its most recurrent and striking qualities: desire. Emerging from the psychiatric context—e.g. the clinic of La Borde—these desiring-machines open a plane beyond the “technic:” beyond “gadgets, or little home-made inventions, or … our phantasies;” they cannot be equated with real machines. Politicizing the unconscious, desiring-machines rather name a radical process of transmutation: a hybrid between inner and outer spaces, between human and non-human: “the existence of a machinic phylum.” This exercise invites revisiting contemporary forms of intimacy, ridding thought of cliched dualisms and classical continuities. Desiring-machines are neither subjects or objects of interaction, neither triggers of intimacy nor its conditions of possibility. Rather, they offer a phylogenetic decomposition of the very notion of subjectivity. From this vantage point we restage an array of scenarios in which the prevailing insistence on interiority and depth coexists with proliferating rampant processes of extimacy. Abnegating a distinction between inside and outside, this analytical lens instead focuses on a machinic coupling of heterogeneous elements.
