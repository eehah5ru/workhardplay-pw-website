The performance takes place on Instagram live - and is a 2 person shared screen. Both screens - will feature a pair feet. One screen will be set in an urban environment (Oslo) stomping a pair of shoes made of clay - in Oslo there is night - and traffic sounds. The other screening is set in a rural environment - happening in Northern Norway where there is still sun(midnight sun) we will see a pair of naked feet - sinking in to a mud hole. The piece is a grounding ritual for the summer solstice - where we are exploring ways of becoming one with the ground. As the sun in North of Norway never go down in summer - we want to play with these contrasts - as the movement of the sun is how we define time. Light - dark, day-night, Urban - rural. What connects us. In the same way that the sun get born every morning.
