The performance will focus on a first person account of a woman who has an overwhelming and obsessive interest in Mycology (a branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi) and consciously decides to symbiotically merge into the wet rot fungi growing in her home. In mythology there are many tales of women turning into plants and trees; mainly not through choice and sometimes as a punishment. However the central character in the performance decides to merge with the fungi in her house through choice in order to become a part of the network of mycelium (the roots spreading from the fungi through the house). Her obsession with fungi has led to a desire for her to exist symbiotically with the organism â€“ in this work she describes her fascination with the environmental and medicinal benefits of fungi, and why she has an intense need to become part of the fungal network. As the central character merges and metamorphoses into the organism she finds that she can control the growth of the mycelium through meditation and breathing patterns. The growth speed is shown through the timelapse video of slime mould that begins slowly and gradually accelerates as she reaches symbiotic bliss with the wet rot fungi which has spread into every section of the house.
