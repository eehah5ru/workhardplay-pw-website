Today we call you to follow the instructions ~ scores ~ exercises as a practice of dispersed collectivity - as an attempt to live this day together at a distance. Some of the instructions are in the schedule grid, some of the instructions you can self-organize in a collective chat, luring others to joint practice and sharing your performance experience.
