We invite you to start this day with a night that opens with a 4-minute song by Anna Kinbom. We invite you to begin your acquaintance with the infrastructure and calendar of WHPH and prepare for diving inside of collective practices. In the evening, we will join online activities for several hours through video calls and streams that touch, play, or explore existing online platforms, practices, tools ~ ​​~ ~
