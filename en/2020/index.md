This year Work Hard! Play Hard! happens in a distributed manner: in order to be together, we do not always need to be present in one physical space. In the time of pandemic, border closures and restrained mobility, it would have been the most obvious decision to cancel the event. The working group proposes to test - test test test - the possibilities of dispersed collectivity and intimacy, where touches, connections, solidarity can happen at a distance: in chat rooms, scores and voice messages.

Work Hard! Play Hard! tests the changing possibilities of being together, working and relaxing together, not attempting to substitute collectivity with draining online activity and to reproduce the virtual double-gangers of our actions and experience, but rather trying to re-assemble and reconfigure digital tools and spaces. We question the usual frame of the event and the channels of its transmission, relying on underwater communication between the lines of the schedule, on the co-presence of practices, on the exchange of instructions.

For this, we use a system of chats and sound channels â€” of attraction, care, sharing and seduction; as a tool for self-organization, where you can find feeds with different discussions.

This year, WHPH suggests to experiment with intimate and collective infrastructures and interfaces, to find ourselves in time gaps and failures, to become friends with uncertainty and contingency. Our program was formed through a series of letters sent from the future. Each of them invited to join one of the drifting slots, which opened for a certain period of time.
