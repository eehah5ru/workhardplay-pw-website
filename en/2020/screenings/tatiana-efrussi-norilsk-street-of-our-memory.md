The film documents a performative event organized in December 2019 in Norilsk, Russia. Its central element was the guided bus tour around one of the streets of the city - Sevastopolskaya. In the 1940s Sevastopolskaya was designed and built up by the prisoners who were the main population of the Arctic camp-city. By the 1980s, a significant part of the original structures decayed and was demolished. The demolition provoked intense protest and debate among the Norilsk public, who still remember Sevastopolskayaâ€™s houses and its atmosphere with nostalgia.

As in some of my other works here I try to provoke re-thinking of the present through research of the past and its activating. The project was disguised in habitual forms of getting-together (collective meal, guided tour in a bus) in order to defamiliarize the environment and question the act of nostalgic remembering.
