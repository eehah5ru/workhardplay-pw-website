The graphic score is assembled, and then iterated over and read in its own way. I want this
podcast to be (not) collected by me too, and then reassembled by you, her, them, that. Who
experiences this, and escapes, who tries to write.
Ephemeral as a naturally intense curiosity.


Fuzzy sound score. A disassembled score that refuses to influence. Vision. Meditations shifted to deep doing.
Actively imagine, feel the present, remember, but convey something else.
