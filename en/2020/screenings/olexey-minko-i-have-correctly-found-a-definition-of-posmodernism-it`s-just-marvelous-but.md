1\. Account [lehaminko](https://www.instagram.com/lehaminko/){target="_blank"} puts a user in documentation of fantasms of collective unconscious. Gaps, which appeared because of post-socialism lateness, are the gaps between propagandas, ultra-right merch, queer-fashion, political agitation and mass culture. They form the unique gaze from the body on itself, country and its time. Queer-provocation is organic for post-socialism, because departing from socialism, as a departing from normativity, requires regular experimentation with views on self-representation and environment. And furthermore, it requires to innovate new instruments for interactions of individual and environment through material of present history.

2\. I have been posting on Instagram since 2016. During this period have happened (successful/ not successful) decommunization and (successful/ not successful) reforms in Ukraine. Till now lasts the hybrid war provoked by Russia. Developing of identity of post-Maidan Ukraine and my identity develops simultaneously. I started to fixating that process since the moment I turned 15. Soon, I had imprisoned by the account and his provocative language, which I used to represent the reality around me.  When I started to depart from provocation in life, people started to bring me to my account, hinting that I distanced myself, that truly me exists not now, but then. During the time I have been posting on Instagram I have changed: I grew my hair, have been practicing the contemporary theatre and got imposter syndrome. Three months before I turned 20, I have cut my hair in order to come back to the identity, which had imprisoned me. I need it to take back the energy from it, which was stolen by the governmental and individual changes. Can I call that «TJing» in the terminology of Joel Regev? Not a fantastic, but realistic time travel?
