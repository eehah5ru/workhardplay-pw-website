We suspend how exactly WHPH will happen this year and invite you to join this abductive speculation. We will correspond with you throughout 2 months, together defining what will happen from June 22 to 28 2020. After this date, the time will overturn again.

The structure of the invitation this year is formed by drifting slots, which will open for a certain period of time. You can follow them through our letters. Maybe, you would respond to the opened slot-parameter, maybe, you would like to wait for the adjacent one and to play the lottery with time.

You can forward these letters to anyone, who might be interested, but we kindly ask you not to publish them to social networks. 

Work Hard! Play Hard! is a self-organized initiative. Unfortunately we do not have the budget
to provide financial assistance to participants, but we try our best to ensure all the desired conditions for your non/work and to set up a supporting infrastructure.
