Dears,

Tomorrow we had the same dream:

_We know what will happen today, but don’t know yet what happened yesterday. We got a job as time players, where we try to grasp distributed collectivity by the tail, like a cat._

But how not to stumble upon our own tail and not to mislead ourselves? Our task is not to start reproducing online-double-gangers of our activity and experience, but rather to dive, with a time difference, into the nourishing pool of dispersed collectivities, inventing forms of co-presence, co-liveliness, co-stratifying, co-becoming and multitudes of co-.

We would like to construct and fill in  with you one of the support structures, one of the calendars, one of the scenarios of the present. To extend the idea of temporality – the social organization of time, and infrastructures – caring and tyrannical carcasses. Deformation of time (alienation, dislodging, overlapping, theft) and fragmentation of space (thickening, control, passages making) formulate the grid of the abductive invitation by WHPH working group. Abductive reasoning, unlike other cognitive procedures, offers sensitivity to incorporate new variables and vague situations simultaneously to development of hypotheses, visions and practices. 


Today is June 21, the day before WHPH begins. 

Till the next letter,  
your [WHPH working group](/$lang$/about.html)
