Dears,

On the way back in our letters we pass by:

Push notifications, red and green lines on the yandex map, voice assistants, traffic lights --- which are all the time "online" --- with an indicator of the number of cars, self-synchronizing ships in the same world of waters, surveillance cameras with a common "host".

They lead us into the tunnels of new sensitivity. A machine of digital sensitivity where the sensitivity does not always belong to us.

The long-awaited torrent file that no one is distributing right now. A hot spot on an airplane designed just for two. An intimate alliance of interfaces moving in space at a speed of 950&nbsp;km/h. Our machines in flight touch each other with tentacles of protocols.

**We invite you to burrow holes in seemingly stable "online" frames, to occupy sensors that are (non)adherent to a body, to go off the roads that policies for using tools are offering, to thematize an algorithmically arranged distributed sensitivity, where the result is not equal to the sum of the parts. We invite you to test your [[ENVIRONMENTS]{.variant}[SETTINGS]{.variant}[TRAJECTORIES]{.variant}]{.flickering-term} through technologically warmed-up landscapes.**
