Dear readers of the invitation to the slot of broken temporality,

You know, that something happens to time. It sparkles, overheats, leaks and disconnects. Alarm clocks are ticking according to their own calendars through a myriad of ringtones, redistributing the streams of conventional time, shared between us. Alarm clocks and other devices produce their chronopolitics --- the way of living time through, of running wild and getting lost in time during the pandemic, of warning signs, deadlines and accelerated visions of the future. What happens if time gets back to its place? And where is its place in postsocialism? Not that scanty imposed geography of ruins and poverty, but as a global condition that defines living forms. 

Susan Buck-Morss admits that the prefix post in post-Soviet marks the ontology of time in contrast to the ontology of collectivity implied in the Soviet. This ontology of time, anchored in the prefix post- implicates the lack of right to be contemporary, embeds the clear relations of domination and submission. 

But what if this uncertainty, this moving backwards and the lack of utopic horizon is the very [queerrrr time of postsocialism?]{.huge-text}

Following feminist [scholars](https://feminist.krytyka.com/en/articles/rethinking-postsocialism-interview-neda-atanasoski-and-kalindi-vora) one can see postsocialism through queer temporality, where different types of relations with historical past and unexpected connections that resists normative --- linear and teleological --- concepts of time could be found. This temporality can confront "straight time", by amassing various forms of life and non-synchronised subjectivities. To think the notion of queer time broadly, is to think it as a rupture of regular rhythms, as the time against reproduction, (non)shared utopia, manifestations of forgotten sci-fies, as the night.

**BY THIS LETTER, WE INVITE YOU TO PROPOSE ACTIVITY, THAT IMPLIES [[FAILURE]{.variant}[ERROR]{.variant}[RUPTURE]{.variant}[CONDENSATION]{.variant}]{.flickering-term} OF POSTSOCIALIST TIME:**

**The timeslot should include time failures --- time bombs, calls from the past, songs from SUMMER MIX 2027 --- something that would question the stream of time, counting time backwards, attacking the future.**

**1 second --- 1 year --- 2032 --- night**
