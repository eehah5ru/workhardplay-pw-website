This slot is overflowing with submarine current. Through it bodies swaying in the surface are seen. The current is warm. It is mixing with surface waters and tingles the skin with hot sprays ﻩﻩﻩ

This is a call to play with us in an intimate infrastructure and apply for the ROLE / CARE PRACTICES / MISSIONS / UNDERWATER, which will accompany us for one week.

We would like to reveal the synthesis of affect, to make sensual adventure accomplices out of us, floating in the computational waters, a distributed care cooperative.

You can claim the role of "being yourself" or become someone with a shifted identity, with shifted edges of your subjectivity. How much you shift your borders is up to you.

Roles thematise the space between events in the schedule grid. They happen somewhere between the lines when you glance at the color fill of the website. They are a hidden engine of events. We would like to think about physical distance and social intimacy. About the fragile infrastructure that tingles the skin with hot sprays ﻩﻩﻩ ﻩﻩﻩ

**To do this, you are invited to the most secret and important [[ROLE]{.variant}[CARE PRACTICES]{.variant}[MISSIONS]{.variant}[UNDERWATER]{.variant}]{.flickering-term} (several can be chosen):**

**[~]{.arrow} those who rise to the surface of the water with caution ~ who feel not-like-fish-in-water among large groups of people and need a supporting fin ~**

**[~]{.arrow} those who feel the power of the waves in themselves and the witching power to help~to mediate~to support the drowning people ~ who feel the energy of collectivity and can become an active fellow ready to be there for others.**

**[~]{.arrow} those who value the intimacy of random connections, who want to dive right into the network of strangers ~ who value temporary spontaneous intimate algorithmic zones.**

**[~]{.arrow} those who want to offer a different underwater role ~ (please specify your role when filling out the form, we will take it into account while designing our watery realm of relations).**

**[>]{.arrow} you can dive into this slot via the link [------>]{.arrow} [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2CmtT_wBmnpjsiJSTCEDwt9RAwiiaoErbLlP19yWcWmPCtw/viewform){target="_blank"}**

**[>]{.arrow} this form will close on 22/06/20 at 23:59:59 Minsk time ⏰&nbsp;[&nbsp;]{.countdown data-closing-time="$closingTime$"}**

**Do not tell anyone about your ~ role / practice of caring / mission / underwater / role ~ neither now nor during the week. How much you want to get it alive / activate / fit in / dive is up to you. Before the week, we will create an intimate infrastructure, let you know how to use it, and connect you according to your roles, (non-)motivation and contingency.**
