dear readers of the invitation to the slot of flickering co/presence,

while we are writing this text, we imagine how your gazes travel along the lines, catching up, surpassing, uniting.

we imagine how you imagine this invitation, the choreography of our visions, which transcends the body, room, house, neighbourhood, borders.

we imagine what will happen in late June, mid-June, early June, mid-May, late April, tomorrow morning, in 2 hours, yesterday.

we get up, we take a breath, pull the shoulder blades together, our calf muscles are relaxed, we make a circular motion with our right arm and start moving, we imagine that our spine is a fountain; it pulls the whole body along ↑

we would love this to be a letter and an impulse,

a letter as a hail

hey, yo, oh, ouch, hello, name, touch of a shoulder, call, flashing of a screen,
