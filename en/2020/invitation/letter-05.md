Dear she-friend, he-friend, they-friends,

We look at the petals of the present, which is in dormancy. In a state of uncertaintу, adaptive adjustments, a state of "reduced functional activity of living organisms, due to environmental conditions, while maintaining their high vitality."

Today is [[January]{.variant}[February]{.variant}[March]{.variant}[April]{.variant}[May]{.variant}[June]{.variant}[July]{.variant}[August]{.variant}[September]{.variant}[October]{.variant}[November]{.variant}[December]{.variant}]{.flickering-term}&nbsp;[[01]{.variant}[02]{.variant}[03]{.variant}[04]{.variant}[05]{.variant}[06]{.variant}[07]{.variant}[08]{.variant}[09]{.variant}[10]{.variant}[11]{.variant}[12]{.variant}[13]{.variant}[14]{.variant}[15]{.variant}[16]{.variant}[17]{.variant}[18]{.variant}[19]{.variant}[20]{.variant}[21]{.variant}[22]{.variant}[23]{.variant}[24]{.variant}[25]{.variant}[26]{.variant}[27]{.variant}[28]{.variant}[29]{.variant}[30]{.variant}[31]{.variant}]{.flickering-term} and you are reading an invitation letter into the slot of an extended present.

Machines, mechanisms, algorithms of apprehension, formulations glide along the "frames" of attention which not only frame, but also support.

Today is [[January]{.variant}[February]{.variant}[March]{.variant}[April]{.variant}[May]{.variant}[June]{.variant}[July]{.variant}[August]{.variant}[September]{.variant}[October]{.variant}[November]{.variant}[December]{.variant}]{.flickering-term}&nbsp;[[01]{.variant}[02]{.variant}[03]{.variant}[04]{.variant}[05]{.variant}[06]{.variant}[07]{.variant}[08]{.variant}[09]{.variant}[10]{.variant}[11]{.variant}[12]{.variant}[13]{.variant}[14]{.variant}[15]{.variant}[16]{.variant}[17]{.variant}[18]{.variant}[19]{.variant}[20]{.variant}[21]{.variant}[22]{.variant}[23]{.variant}[24]{.variant}[25]{.variant}[26]{.variant}[27]{.variant}[28]{.variant}[29]{.variant}[30]{.variant}[31]{.variant}]{.flickering-term} and we do not know how the situation will unfold in the future. This unknown has two overlapping dimensions --- unknown of particularities and unknown of methods/tools they can be grasped with.

We invite you to join the game with unknown unknowns. To try to grab the joy from this situation. Let the game be called "how far everything can go."

This slot is a collective mapping of uncertainties. Risk, volatility, blur, memory loss, flux, chaos, dance of statistical errors, perplexity from the invasion of all of the above into your locality.

**With this letter, we suggest you make yourself comfortable in contradictions. Do not cancel or affirm one form of event. To be entirely not there and not here --- in both places simultaneously and alternately.**

**We welcome:**  
**[~]{.arrow} not specific fantasms, but ways to generate them;**  
**[~]{.arrow} discussion of asynchrony, which go to asynchronous actions;**  
**[~]{.arrow} search for a fork, where everything went as it went ✸ ✸ ✸ from this fork-slingshot, the possibilities to beat the glass ceilings of the imagination are revealed;**  
**[~]{.arrow} present as [[coherence]{.variant}[conjunction]{.variant}[rupture]{.variant}]{.flickering-term}.**

**Everything will be resolved by a round dance of uncertainty on one of the days of WHPH. Remember that your part of the round dance should be compact in order to leave space for other variants of blurred temporalities.**

**[>]{.arrow} registration form of your uncertainty [----->]{.arrow} [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei-Pr_RFpgZS2fb8Ydknks68G1x4oQ8F8vtsyNfcoquHP1xg/viewform){target="_blank"}**

**[>]{.arrow} this form will close on 11.06.20 at 12:34:56 Minsk time ⏰&nbsp;[&nbsp;]{.countdown data-closing-time="$closingTime$"}**

**[*]{.arrow} A round dance of uncertainties will condense on one of the days of the WHPH week 22---28 June 2020, or might go beyond its limits.**
