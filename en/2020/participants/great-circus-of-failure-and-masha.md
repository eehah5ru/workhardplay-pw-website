The score ‘Randevu’ is an attempt to formalize and structure an experience in distance communication explored by Masha Komarova and Great Circus of Failure from winter 2019 and spring 2020.  
Great Circus of Faliruse was found by Masha Fomenko and Petr Laden in the spring of 2018. Working with interactive performances and new media, Circus is exploring the forms of co-creation and fragile sincere interspecies coexistence.  
Masha Komarova is a Belarusian artist, currently based in Brussels. She is interested in postdramatic theatre and intermedia arts. Everyday aesthetics plays an important role in Masha’s artistic approach. The perception and experience of objects from both points of view of a spectator and a consumer afterwards find a reflection in Masha’s art works.
