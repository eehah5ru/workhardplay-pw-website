I work mainly with video, which are material manipulations of our digital environment. I composite taken and found footage, CGI animations, and hand-drawn graphics to examine and define digital social realisms and futurities. My practice is often collaborative, and I have collaboratively developed several performances over recent years which examine feminist collectives and possible futures. I’m one of the founders of 0s+1s Collective; and I have been privileged to show my video and performance work with other members of the collective at WH!PH! In 2017 and 2019. Recent exhibitions include: Arte por los Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2020); The Tallinn Feminist Forum, Estonian Academy of Arts, Tallinn, Estonia (2019); Nina, K and Connie, WH!PH! Side Affects, Minsk, Belarus (2019); The Future was at her Fingertips: Digital ambivalence, Cyborging and Technofeminism, Södertälje Art Gallery, Sweden (2018;) Mozart's Ghost, Gothenburg Art Museum, Sweden (2017-2018); The Legacy Complex, Casa Victor Hugo, Havana, Cuba and Gotland's Art Museum, Visby, Sweden (both 2017); WH!PH!, Minsk Belarus (2017); Artists’ Moving Image Festival, Tramway, Glasgow, UK (2016); and The London Feminist Film Festival, Rio Cinema, London, UK (2016). I have a BA (Hons) in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and an MFA in Fine Art from Goldsmiths, University of London.
