Alex Anikina (b. Kolomna, Russia) is a media artist, film-maker, researcher and curator. She recently completed her PhD at Goldsmiths, University of London, and currently teaches at London South Bank University. Her current project focuses on political aesthetics of ‘procedural films’ – media works that use generative algorithmic techniques but operate in a succinctly filmic domain. As an artist, she works with moving image, digital media, software and lecture-performances. Her work has been shown internationally, including VI Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art; Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin; Gaîté Lyrique, Paris; Anthology Film Archives, New York; NCCA Moscow; Korean Film Archive and, most recently, Art Sonje museum, Seoul, Sanatorium gallery, Istanbul, Krasnoyarsk Museum Biennale. Her works are held in the collection of NCCA (ROSIZO), Moscow. In 2018 she co-curated IMPAKT media art festival with the theme ‘Algorithmic Superstructures’.
