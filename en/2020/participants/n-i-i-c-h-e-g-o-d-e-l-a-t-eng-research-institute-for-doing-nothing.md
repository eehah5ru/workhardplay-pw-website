We honestly admit to ourselves that our present desire is to do nothing. We honestly admit to ourselves that we doubt. And we see that we are many. 
n i i c h e g o d e l a t (eng. “Research Institute for Doing Nothing”) is a network of flickering laboratories, researching opportunities for overcoming present standards of labour behaviour. n i i c h e g o d e l a t raises questions of emancipation of workers from alienated labour, and the unemployed from social stigmatization, it deals with the problem of unpaid invisible labour, and resurrects the utopian tradition of striving for the future world without work. The main goal of the Research Institute is to consider "doing nothing" and its other varieties (procrastination, passivity, apathy, idleness, etc.) as a public phenomenon requiring comprehensive study, both theoretical and practical.
