atom is an art group formed by Alisa Oleva and Timothy Maxymenko. we move, listen, trespass, infiltrate, climb, jump over, overhear, touch. we are interested in testing and programming and then offering portals, spaces in between, shared encounters, meeting places, scores for movement and communication. our experiences are most often one-to-one, in small groups, outside, intimate, in between.
