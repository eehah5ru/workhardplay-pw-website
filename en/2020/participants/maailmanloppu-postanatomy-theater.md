MAAILMANLOPPU postanatomy theater project  (Alexandra Abakshina and Alina Shklyarskaya)  from Saint-Petersburg, - forms mobile alliances, creative groups, integrates various types of knowledge and practices to   investigate  the phenomena of modern reality. The authors claim that only modern theatrical practices can present the phenomenon (including scientific one) as a real experience. The group's artistic practice is emergency mode, the image abandoning, preferring to  implement  literally to provoke the audience's gaze/hearing without involving them.
