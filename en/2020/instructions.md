We invite you to practice the instructions ~ scores ~ exercises ~ scripts as a practice of dispersed collectivity â€” as an attempt to live this time through together at a distance.

These instructions and scores respond to the [~ slot of flickering co/presence ~]{.shiny}. They involve individual or group performance at any time during the WHPH Test Test Test program or beyond it. Apart from that, Tuesday / June 23 and Sunday / June 28 in the schedule are specially allocated for these activities. We encourage everyone to discuss, share experiences and arrange joint performance in the [collective chat](https://discord.gg/n5JBf8x){target="_blank" class="shiny"} / [instruction how to use chat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mY2nBkpYQM9JLpISi-L6JJW02TYJaexmDyBCxR21w7U/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}.
