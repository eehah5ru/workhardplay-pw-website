Since 2017, he has been a member of the research team of the Czechoslovak psychotronics’, which is researching its institutional and ideological connections as well as its potential overlaps with contemporary art. In his work, Peter Sit is interested in collectivity and its potential in today's world order, work issues, radical hospitalism, and an imagination of a better future. As an artist, he is examining  an extended field of artist's activity across an entire range of artistic production. Moving across and combining the positions of artist, organizer, publisher, curator, editor is a crucial part of the artist's practice.
