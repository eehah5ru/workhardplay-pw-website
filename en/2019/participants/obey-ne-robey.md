Nicolay Spesivtsev is an artist and researcher based in Moscow, Russia. With a technical background as a computer scientist, Spesivtsev combines a critical approach to computer science that is interwoven with computational economies and queer futurism. He works with imaginations born from overlapping technological, economical, and political landscapes in present day culture.

His interests include solidarity born from affective labor, critical approaches to emancipation of joy from assemblages of bodies of living subjects (human and non-human), and systems based on computation, digital decolonialism in Eastern Europe, among many others.

He is part of the group eeefff  and Flying Cooperation. He co-organizes the annual event WORK HARD! PLAY HARD! in Minsk.
