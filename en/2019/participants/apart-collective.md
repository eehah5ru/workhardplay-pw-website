APART performs research, creative and artistic production, project- and exhibition-making / curatorial production, publication and archiving. The artists initiate, create, organise and exhibit group manifestations (often inviting and giving space to other artists and theoreticians) but they also operate individually.

APART is a meta-participative platform. APART works on a proto-institutional basis – under the principle of shared economies, it slots its poly-subjectivity into what is currently desired and related within its context. Rather than building new networks they aim at activating the acceleration of existing intellectual and poetical synapses worthy of attention. They know that nature is already saturated with networks.

APART was formed at the turn of 2011 and 2012.

APART is a Slovak artist cooperative. Today, its members include Ema Hesterová, Denis Kozerawski, Chiara Rendeková, Andrej Žabkay.
