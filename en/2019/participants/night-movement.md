Movement Night (2015 -) is an engine of a variety of collective activities, which manifest themselves mainly at the Night. The aesthetic language of the Movement refers to the lyrical and dreamy tradition of the nocturne of the 19th century, to the gothic and romantic style in literature and art, as well as to the current (modern\contemporary) situation of the vibration between day and night according  to work and rest schedules. We explore human instincts that darkness provokes, along with social obligations that are characteristic of daylight. Each event is developed together by stable members of the Movement and invited collaborators. We work without being tied to the medium, however, the construction of situations in which participants have the opportunity to live through unobvious, most often primitive episodes is the most attractive for us. We see the Night as a physical space that no one has owned before us, we occupy it and share it with all sympathizers. To date, the Night Movement involves more than two thousand people around the world.
