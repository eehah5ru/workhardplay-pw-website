Matthieu Levet is a Brussels based musician and artist. He have a long term interest in the practice of sound in the art context, as a medium to explore and express metaphorically the grey zones that defines humans individually as much as collectively. During the last past years, he felt the need to travel east extensively (Poland, Slovakia, Hungaria, Czech Republic, Serbia, Macedonia, Baltics) and started building a transborder horizontal network of  friends and collaborators.

Matthieuâ€™s participation in the first Camp As One residency in Russia was a defining turning point in his evolution and practice and he is now actively collaborating with friends from Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Poland... as a musician and as a publisher (he started a record label called Cold Moss earlier this year).
