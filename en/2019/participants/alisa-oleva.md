born 1989 in Moscow. based in London. alisa oleva holds an MA in Performance from Goldsmiths. her practice aims to offer an alternative way to experience and engage with the everyday urban life around us by shifting the sense of real and imaginary within the cityscape. she treats the city as her studio and urban life as material, to consider issues of private and public, visible and invisible, urban choreography and urban archeology, traces and surfaces, borders and inventories, voids and silences.
