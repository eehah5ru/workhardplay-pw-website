The Future Body at Work is an interdisciplinary score-based study practice initiated and run by Frida Sandstr√∂m and Kasia Wolinska. It mobilizes ideas, theories, and practices centered on the body at work. Affirming the living body, a revolution of consciousness is initiated and the inherent sociality of the dancing body is reclaimed.
