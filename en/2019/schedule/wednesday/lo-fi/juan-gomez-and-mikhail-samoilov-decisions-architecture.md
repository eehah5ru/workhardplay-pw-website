Decisions architecture is a participatory performance that invites participants to explore the aesthetics of decision making and some of the cognitive biases that humans are subject to in their daily life. To cite some of them:

IKEA EFFECT: The tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end result or OSTRICH EFFECT: Ignoring an obvious (negative) situation.

The experience takes place in a grid that had been conceived to recreate some of the decisional spaces that architecture has built such as parliaments and stock market buildings.

The experience consists of creating playful in-between moments between the participants to generate —Åonversations and exchange of actions to make them aware of their decisional moments.
