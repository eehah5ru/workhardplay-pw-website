Aleksei Borisonok proposes to read a few texts by our friends and comrades on the issues of disease and body affects, private and shared memory, commons and singularity as a way to collectively celebrate and mourn those who are no longer with us. The abstracts of texts by Alina Popa, Sasha Novozhenova and 16 Beaver collective will be provided at the meeting. The method of reading will be discussed collectively.
