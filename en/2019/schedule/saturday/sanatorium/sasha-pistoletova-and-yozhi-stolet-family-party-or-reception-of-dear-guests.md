I will cook beshbarmak for the first time for guests. I will not it
rehearse. But something I really repeat. What my repeats
Mom for Kazakhs. What do they repeat? Repetition and distinction? In that
Dish is important to catch the simplicity. The simplicity of five fingers (bes-five, barma -
fingers). I was born in the city of Arkalyk. We have mixed with Kazakhs
family. I grew up on beshbarmak. My mother is Russian. She began to cook
beshbarmak as a Kazakh woman only when we moved to Russia. Probably
because in Arkalyk, there were enough Kazakh women in our family to
cook cool besh. Mom got a bag where she put
the most expensive. Our family left postcards of the city of Arkalyk. This
the city has become a ghost town. Beshbarmak and cards - in our family
bag we carry with us as nomads. Kazakhs do not know the rhythm. Have
nomads no closed loop. Their movements occur by
crescent loop. This means that you cannot return, and this
It means that you are the worst dancing. Good thing rave culture canceled
the concept of "good dancing." Kazakhstan is very dear to me. 
I want to pass it my family - Yozhi Stolet. Let it happen right there during her report on the world after love.
