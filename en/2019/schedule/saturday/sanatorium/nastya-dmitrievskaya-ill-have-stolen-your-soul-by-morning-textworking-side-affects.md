The brilliance of polished manuscript, as a rule, obscures the work (and even more affects) associated with the writing, editing, proofreading and translation of texts. From posts, conversations, nervous calls we do know what happens to our friends when they work on the text. What if we try to take these affects and work out of the space of personal experience and try to think about them politically and physiologically?
