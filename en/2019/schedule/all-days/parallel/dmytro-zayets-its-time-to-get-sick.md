A pure perception of pain does not exist and we cannot experience the pain of the other just like our own. The sensation of pain, and especially mental pain, is affected by a multitude of knowledge and skills which we resort to, in order to provide or receive care. Due to the fact, that this knowledge and skills vary from group to group, from class to class, it is sometimes difficult for us to empathize and help each other.
Using a silent survey technique, we will try to find out: which pain or anti-care regimens exist today? How does pain set urban rhythms, is the city a source of constant pain, indisposition, and irritation? How does the rationality of the city respond to the pain of a citizen? How do people get away from the city structures of pain relief ? How do they "give will to the pain"?
