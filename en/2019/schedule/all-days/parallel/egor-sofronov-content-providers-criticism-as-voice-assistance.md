Conversations with participants and others, so that ideas, their gestation, alienation, and replication would clarify and transmit via voice, this phenomenon of embodied, unstable materiality, via encounter and attention. In coalescence of intellectual labor with affective what comes forward is care, maintenance of an economy. Interlocutor is a virus of care, hostis: both an enemy and a hospitable container.
Anthropological dimension of conversation anticipates incommensurable scales of crisis of unsustainability and extinction, where accelerating and lagging economies of inhuman extraction compete with depleting resource of possible reproduction, of bodies, ecosystems, political and aesthetic resistances, which will be the subject of conversations as dyadic situations.
Receptive of the critique of phallogocentrism and its autoimmunizing assertion, I seek to replace with hearing, attention the monological construction of patriarchal discourse.
The rhetoric of the call with its medicalist, geo- and biological optics as in sci-fi that defamiliarizes antropomorphic norms, motivates to clarify and transmit the method behind it and emergences summoned by it in the contributions of others. Others: Eastern, neighborly, more anti-patriarchal and inventive, bearing another pain but enduring it in transmissible and socializable vibrations.
Our position is being transformed under the diktat of algorithmic recoding, liquidation of past cultural formations: populations of the reserve army superfluous for plutocratic accumulations and platform monopolies are amortized by pharmacological and somatic compensations, always-already insufficient, prolonging the lack of distress and patterns of anaesthesizing subsistence. Having decided to be faithful to this position, overdetermined by the division of labor, I hear and repeat: “I am a content provider, and I can be as sharp and empathetic as a voice assistant.”
