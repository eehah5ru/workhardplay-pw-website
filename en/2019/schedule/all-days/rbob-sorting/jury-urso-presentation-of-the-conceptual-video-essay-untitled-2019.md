I want to show conceptual video-essay which deals with certain important topics that concern me: from suicide to contemporary art, from refusal to work to the mechanisms of the institutions of contemporary art. Conceptually my video-essay is divided into three parts: the First, the Third and the Second worlds. This division was relevant before the fall of Berlin wall and I choose this order, because the First and the Third worlds had connection between each other, because the former colonized the latter, but the Second world was an alternative. I think, that after the fall of the Eastern block the border with European union transformed into the new Berlin wall. In this sense, it is very interesting to consider the geopolitical situation of such countries as Belarus where is this new Berlin wall is located. Anyway, one of the main points of my work is to understand what is the role do we play, post-soviet people? Does someone care about our culture somewhere outside of our regions?
