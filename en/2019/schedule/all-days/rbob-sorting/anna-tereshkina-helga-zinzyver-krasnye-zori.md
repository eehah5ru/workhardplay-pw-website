Weâ€™d like to make a disco/gig and talk about internal working of self-proclaimed musical collaborations. Our collective itself is a method of selfcare. On the discussion we want to talk about relationships that are generated in collective work provided horizontal, empathic and caring, as well as accepting one's own and someone else's weakness. This is invisible work of each of us.
