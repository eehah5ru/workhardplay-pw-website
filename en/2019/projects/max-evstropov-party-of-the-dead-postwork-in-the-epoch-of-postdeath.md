Lecture/performance from behalf of a delegate of the party of the dead was an attempt to analyse the current global condition of work, capital and death – the situation in which work is no longer work and death is no longer death but capital still remains as a sort of an empty constant. It was also a necro-philological enterprise: the basis of the lecture/performance was within the close reading of “Le Squelette laboureur” (“The Hard-Working Skeleton”) by Charles Baudelaire.
