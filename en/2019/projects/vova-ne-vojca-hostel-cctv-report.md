Screening of a short pseudo-fiction film, made from records by cctv cameras in hostel.

The video of real robbery is presented as a clip, referring to the cliche of the of criminal drama genre.

A follow-up report on personal experience of re-socialization in a hyper-multicultural environment - a port city hostel - by using screen-voyeurism and creating own virtual narratives. The report will be accompanied by a display and commenting on a series of photographs from cctv cameras.
