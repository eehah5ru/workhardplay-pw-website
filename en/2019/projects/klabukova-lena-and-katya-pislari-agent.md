Our organization participates in the third stage of the prelaboratory analysis of a family of active agents, or a single agent in a series of states, acting inside the human body and exhibiting virus-like properties, as well as complex mutual activity with indirect correlations. Provisionally the most distinct agent subtypes are being called “Love” and “Non-Love”. The exact design was not yet fully discovered but it has been traced that the mutual amount of different subtypes of the agent directly or inversely correlates with the levels of affordance of a number of primary neurotransmitters. This makes it possible to indirectly assess the state of an individual, but the individual herself through her cognitive-emotional activity creates an environment of varying levels of auspiciousness for one or another form of the active agent. It has also been established that both the family of agents and the corresponding cognitive-emotional states are capable of being transmitted through social environment.

At this stage, we conducted a series of experiments related to the agent's mutagenic ability and aim to develop a conceptual grid for further stages of the study. It is important to note that at the moment the most interesting directions of agents’ mutations are located outside the axes defined by the tunnel aggravation. Also, it has not been established whether there exist individuals / groups of individuals which are not influenced by this family of agents. At the current stage, we plan tested small selections of highly cognitive participants capable of correct self-observation and evaluation.
