Ways of entry and exclusion are born in the "current" methods of communication.

We discover these methods by ourselves. Or capitalist race force us to discover them. To be in touch and to expand not only your voice and the visible image for this connection, but also your body. To regulate and self-regulate constantly.

There are a lot of group chats, vibrations transmitting our messages at a distance, sensors, coordinates with a zero point in the vr helmet. Is this all new sensuality? New sensitivity?

To perceive a new way of communication, as a habitat, to become stratified in it and to re-assemble.
