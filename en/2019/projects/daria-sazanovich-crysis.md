Crysis is a fiction film set in the near future. A future with an extremely high level of air pollution and where the authorities have no intention to fight against it. Moreover, they find a new easily accessible personal identification method through the irritated eyes of the population: the tears are a new unique biometric data. The apathetic mood deterred the mind of clear political thought.
