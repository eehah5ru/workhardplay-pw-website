In this workshop, Frida Sandstrom and Kasia Wolinska shared methods that they have applied when replacing established concepts, names, and references from Western philosophy by concepts from dance and choreography — concepts that are derived directly from the living body at work. This time, the method was embodied by a format in which we engaged with a very simple practice of developing dance, of ‘awakening dance’.

To be present with one’s body-mind, muscle-mind, the me-body in the space of tides, burning fires and of comrading flow, is to observe and feel oneself, in movement just like in words. Acknowledging the movement of one’s surrounding: fellow dancers and absorptions of social constructs, we shake from within - thoughts and aspirations, dreams and grievances. Feeling and articulating, in both dance and words, movements  emerge from the tiniest motion and yet they are realized with a clear purpose. Beyond the artwork as a construct, we both recognise and reshape the material circumstances for existence within movement, in the present moment.
