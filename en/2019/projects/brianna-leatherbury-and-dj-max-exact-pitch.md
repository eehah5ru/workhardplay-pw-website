The project is a collaboration between Brianna Leatherbury and DJ Max. They made a set together that is composed mainly of sounds from a mandatory meeting in a hotel room. Transplanting them onto a dancefloor transforms the function of the recordings from information to entertainment, from focused discussion to ambient rhythm. The recorded movement of the bodies, in turn, produce bodily movement. The project marks two recent interests of Brianna, one of the transformations of labor as material/phase transitions and of the activation of the surrounding air as a means to draw attention to the breath, to the compulsory act of breathing (thus reinforcing the labor and form of the body).
