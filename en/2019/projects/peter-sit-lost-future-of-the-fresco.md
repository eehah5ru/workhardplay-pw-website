Utopian society depicted on the socialist mosaic in the Bratislava railway station serves as departure point for the contemporary story of new APART collective film The Most Beautiful Catastrophe. In the lecture Peter Sit examined how we can dash back to the past to speak about problems in the present, how imagination and visions for the future emerge out of historical experience and are inspired by the visual language of Central European socialism.
