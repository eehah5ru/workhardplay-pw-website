For the picnic we need a park for those, who are poisoned with theory, having indisposition and fallen sick. Recommended: a park within easy reach for all participants. Not recommended: codes, citing, cultural production, production of knowledge, documentation. We are just having a rest and try not to produce anything. Passive rest. We don’t promise anything. It’s not end-of-term exams.
