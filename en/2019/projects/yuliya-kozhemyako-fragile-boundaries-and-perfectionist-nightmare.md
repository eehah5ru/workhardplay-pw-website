Levels in video games are often designed in advance, all objects are located at the places specified by the designer. Other genres use procedural generation and random numbers for level design. In my project I want to delegate role of random numbers to people to see what happens.

The result will be part of video game called Yuha’s Nightmares. This part will be based on one of my last dreams. Рerformance participants can make changes to this level, and I will try to withstand this invasion.
