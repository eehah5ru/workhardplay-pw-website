everyone frozen in anticipation of a surprise from the Night's Movement
where did the night lurk this time? We walk in the dark, every shadow scares us, danger lurks everywhere, every bush seems to be a lurking figure, every rustle may mean that there is the beginning of a mystery, any sound may warn that the night is coming, increasing, attacking - ou-ou-ou-ou!
