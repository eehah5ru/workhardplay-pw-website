Once Lyudmila Zheleznyak (the great-granddaughter of that sailor-anarchist), during the night in a country caravan, decided to light a small stove. She crumpled up a few newspaper pages, hastily put it under a heap of pine chips, brought a match - and suddenly - the flame lit up:
".. after the discovery of afar australopithecus, general excitement reigned in the camp of scientists, the Beatles song _«Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds»_ played on the tape recorder, which later gave the name to the discovery-Lucy .."
So there was Lucy Ferrum. Starring Pasha Gvozd.
