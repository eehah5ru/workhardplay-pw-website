Screening of the television film "His vacation" (1981, G. Polok) and a discussion (moderators: Lina Miadzvedzeva and Maksim Karpitski). The production drama gives us a strange and complex material combining the topic of production and the psychology of interpersonal interaction. Growing into a tangle of issues of the socialist economy, inaccessible to us today, the film gives a space for discussion about the conflict in the cinema, the plot and the personal experience of the audience.
