The major forces of modern societies are aimed at creating things. The value of things depends not only on economic, but also on social parameters. Depending on their status, each thing can be found in the pile of trash, in the shop window or in the museum collection. On the basis of the photo report on a walk through the Paris department store Le BHV, we will try to understand how objects acquire their value in the modern neoliberal economy, and also how products differ from garbage and works of art.
