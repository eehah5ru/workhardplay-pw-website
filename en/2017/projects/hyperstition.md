_"And what if there was no beginning?" (Iain Hamilton Grant)_  

HYPERSTITION: A film on time and narrative. Of thoughts and images. On plants and the outside. Abduction and Recursion. Yoctoseconds and Platonia. Plots and anaerobic organisms. About the movement of thinking and philosophy in anthropology, art, design, economy, linguistics, mathematics, and politics. And back into abstraction.

"You're always at the beginning and always at the end." (Ray Brassier) HYPERSTITION: The retooling of philosophy and political theory for the 21st Century.
