FOUND PROJECT is a project of Anastasia Kizilova, based on a participatory art practice and the principle of exchange. The idea of FOUND PROJECT is to start the exchange process of untapped artistic ideas with the aim to realize them by voluntary participants. Ideas are accepted in the archive on a voluntary basis. After the transfer, the idea is free from the repressive authority of the author and exists in the archive anonymously. Those who wish to take part in the project as donors of ideas can send their unrealized or deferred projects that they are ready to give for a realisation here: foundproject@mail.ru
Or simply [put it here][1]

THERE ARE NO PROJECTS OF OTHERS! THERE ARE IDEAS TO REALIZE!
