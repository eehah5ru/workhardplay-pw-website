There were two inspections of 10-12 people with the duration of 1 hour each:

> “We can not pass by the proletarians of today – programmers. They say that Wargaming is such a large office that every third graduate of the Faculty of Mechanics of BSU works there, and every second BSUIR student dreams to get there. And even the unemployed see game designers training courses in their dreams (in an employment office).

> So, everyone who wants to penetrate the heart of the Belarusian IT industry is  invited to an excursion to Wargaming, the lair of programmers and developers. We will arrange a small labor inspection and see how these lucky ones work: what kind of working environment is in the office, what presents do they give for their bosses birthdays, where do they sit, what kind of cookies do they eat for dinner, and how do they fight for their rights, if they haven’t got the union. We will go through all lanes and alleys of the Wargaming office and try to get  how, why and for what reason the whole office occupies a 16-storey building. Our guide is a professional guide from the IT world.”

The essay written after the labor inspection in Wargaming is available here in English: [Programmers Wannabe by eeefff][1]
