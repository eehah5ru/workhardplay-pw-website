Is the game a rest or a job? We voluntarily join the process, we obey the rules (they were given initially, or been developed by the participants), we live through the situation and thus learn it. Is the game a model or a part of reality? Exercises to build teams in corporate culture, a universe of likes and reposts bearing social significance, the sports industry - we play all the time, we are being played all the time. Is the game an economy or a policy? Today, playing tools are widely used to engage customers and to increase sales. But at the same time the game remains a space where you can imagine the alternative options. Educational-playing anti-bourgeois methods of "Proletcult" in the conditions of modern Minsk.
