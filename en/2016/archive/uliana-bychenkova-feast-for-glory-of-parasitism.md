\*PARASITISM – neuter gender: joyful eating of tuna
In Russian there is a playful meaning of “tunejadsctvo” (en – social parasitism) that is similar to “tuna”. Tuna is a group of marine fish, the name comes from ancient Greek “thynō” – "rush", "throw", with the verb "yasti" (meaning "to eat").
In English the term “parasitism” comes from the ancient Greek παράσιτος (parásitos), "one who lives at another's expense, person who eats at the table of another," used to label the social offender.

\*\* "Astrological news from Prekarisentsy" is a video created within the framework of the training task "Schools of Engaged Art of the group “What is to be done”?" – "News about poverty", a collective of artists: Anna Averyanova, Irina Butkovskaya, Uliana Bychenkova.
