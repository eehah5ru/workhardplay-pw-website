Union “OBSERVATION²” (Aleksei Naumchik and Maksim Sarychev) was formed in the joint work on the topic of control in 2015.  
  
*Participants’ commentaries:*  
  
"On the one hand, we seem to chase an object, a car, an institution and a function (Belarusian television). On the other hand, when we pass by the car and meet the eyes of the driver, another feeling arises that we still pursue a certain person, something personal."
_Alisa Oleva, artist, London_  
  
"The whole performance plays with the subversive affirmation of the power of people with the camera. So here I was in a position that most of the propaganda TV workers probably justify their actions: "I just do my job, and what it's all about is not my concern." The viewer for them is the same anonymous abstract shadow as their silhouettes in the car for me. It's pretty unpleasant to deprive yourself of the privilege of believing that you are something higher than them, to deprive yourself of the comfortable position of a critic who is terrified from the distance by "how the people is being fooled."  
_Tatiana Efrussi, artist, historian of architecture, Moscow-Berlin_  
  
"Our group experiences of fears, stereotypes and the moment of the Other's presence for me is the filling of the performance. In this regard, the video documentation directed inside the machine is the right decision on your part. "  
_Maria Kotlyachkova, curator, Kirkenes_

"When the camera got into my hands, a defense reaction has started - anxiety and fear. You begin to feel very uncomfortable from the fact that you intrude the intimate space of strangers, from whom you are used to distance yourself, even there is a feeling of disgust. However, there is also another point, which was realized already after our excursion - the desire to do it again. To repeat the game action, in which your emotions and feelings were not playable, but very real. "  
_Vasilisa Polyanina-Kalenda, artist, Minsk_  
  
"Being in Minsk less than 24 hours, I was new to the local context. I felt that in the space inside the machine, national and social laws were not applicable. They were replaced by new ones.
At the exit from Belarus (we crossed the Belarusian-Lithuanian border) we were removed from the shelves of the sleeping car at 20 minutes past midnight. That is exactly 20 minutes after the end of the validity of our transit visa. "I'm not going anywhere," I said in Russian, clearly pronouncing the words, "We spent 3 days at the embassies to get them. It's better to stay on the train." "Please take your belongings," our border guard replied. His fist was in a velvet glove, but in the holster on his belt hung a pistol. and there was a spirit of potential violence in the air. Our deportation increased my anxiety about the filming. I was no longer sure that my coquetry could protect us. I ended up on the battlefield, not realizing that I was in the army, and it's time to work out a strategy. "
