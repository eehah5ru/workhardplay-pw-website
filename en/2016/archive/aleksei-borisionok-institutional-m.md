Institutional meditation is a method that was developed at Inverse Institution Workshop 2013 and the Workshop Formats and Forms of Writing workshop. The questions on which the Minsk institutional meditation was based were prepared by Lydia Hamann, Jo Zahn, Inga Zimprich, Janine Eisenächer and Sönke Hallmann. Aleksei Borisionok used questions and the structure of original practice, but edited them for the context of Minsk. Institutional meditation is a method that uses a specific method of questioning the subject and its institutional placements, a space for discussion and (quasi) therapeutic practice.
