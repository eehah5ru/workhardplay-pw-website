Space becomes a place when it has been given a meaning. In project #660099/forest we studied how the Khatyn forest is inscribed in a wider cultural and economic context. Practicing the collection of mushrooms in the forest, we discussed what it is today - work, job, poaching, rest, or eco-lifestyle.
