When one flaneurs in Minsk, being open to new experiences and full of fresh interest - Unexpected Minsk will be revealed to you.. Rough walls..naked laying...surreal forms..incredible objects, that breathe their lives and begin to talk to you.. You get the pass to holes and hollows in the fences, locked doors lead you to what has no name. The space beyond the space unfolds only for you, full of unexplained marks, where intense silence smiles, making you shiver and feel the unrestrained freedom here, in the heart of another Minsk.
