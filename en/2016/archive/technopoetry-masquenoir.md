[TECHNO-POETRY][1]  
St. Petersburg  
social techno / radical post-chanson / emancipatory synth-pop  
"The TECHNO-POETRY cooperative is poetry and music, constantly balancing between the barbarity of feelings and the criticism of pure reason in the search for finding one's self-consciousness." The instrumentalizing of all musical styles and genres, the duo aims to cause in the recipient a critical catharsis, triggering a mechanism of subjectification that translates the aesthetic an illusion in the daily practice of the struggle for emancipation and equality. "
