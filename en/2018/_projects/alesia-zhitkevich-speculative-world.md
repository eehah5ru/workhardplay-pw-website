‘Sitius! Altius! Forty!‘ – the slogan of the Olympics can perfectly describe our contemporary being. Be better, more beautiful, richer, happier, stronger, smile, and consume – all that the capitalist formation provokes us to, in fact, does not make us happier, but generates a feeling of anxiety and prostration. What will happen to us in the future? Will such concepts as transhumanism help alleviate human suffering? Can we radically increase the level of human happiness in a humane way? How effective are psycho-practices and means for fighting suffering?
