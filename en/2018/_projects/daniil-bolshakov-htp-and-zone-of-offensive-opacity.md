With the help of the Andrew Culp’s “Dark Deleuze” project, we’ll try to describe HTP as an “charge that will explode that will explore, make fall what must fall, make escape what must escape” (Anti-Oedipus). But HTP doesn’t undermine the structures of “joyful” productivity and connectivity society, rather it withdrawing post-socialist ideological and repressive apparatus, which is close to dark by their nature. Will it manage to do this by the means of spreading horizontal organization and flat ontologies, someway similar with ontologies in computer science?
