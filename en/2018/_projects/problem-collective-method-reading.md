Inspired by and deconstructing the methods of the early Soviet reading groups aimed at self-education of peasants and workers, and also discussing contemporary state of reading and text, the "Problem Collective" invites to the session of collective reading. The PC offers to read the "List of MOPR Pavilion Exhibits" - a historical document found in the national archives of the Republic of Belarus. The document lists the exhibits that were placed in the MOPR Pavilion at the First All-Belarusian Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition in Minsk (1930). The MOPR Pavilion was built and designed by the artist and constructor Aleksanteri Ahola-Valo, who in the experimental display recorded the history of political violence.
