Intimate DJ set of queer and fem musicians and an interface for the playlist in vkontakte: https://bitchcoin.in/
Exclamations and glued spots by bitchcoin. Speculative disco where music converts into the text and vice versa. The time of an intimate message reading is not equal to the time of set listening.
