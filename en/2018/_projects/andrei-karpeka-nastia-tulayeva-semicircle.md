The semicircle is an artificial canal and a complex engineering structure that seems to be an accidental natural artefact. Its material forms embody the rationality to which the socialist city was subject: the maximization of production, the improvement of health, the provision of leisure. To make nature work for the city, it was necessary to build a large-scale engineering and landscape-architectural system, which it is now unable to support.

We invite you for a walk to the architectural dream, which could be fulfilled only under socialism.
