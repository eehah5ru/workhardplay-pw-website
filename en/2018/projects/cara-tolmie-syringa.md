Syringa is a performance work using voice, fragile touch and music. It is a delicate balancing act, fluttering on the blurry shift between interior and exterior positioning. Syringa is a disposition that listens to and learns from small sounds, repetitive operations, skipping records, self soothing hands, non-human rhythms and explosive sampling.
