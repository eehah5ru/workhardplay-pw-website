Suppose a patient comes to a session of psychoanalysis and lies on the couch. Does he/she work at this time? Does he/she rest? Or, more precisely, what is inside of him that does a work in the process of analysis? And from what does he/she rest at the session? Finally, what does he/she pay for? What is the specificity of the work of a psychoanalyst? In what relations is it with hard work of a scientist - for example, Faust? How does the psychoanalytic concept of pleasure relate to the modern neoliberal conditions of production, labor and leisure?
