Meeting of the reading group "Succulent therapy" with the involvement of people and plants, in particular succulents in one of the places of transparency in Minsk. The project explores the posthumanistic and non-humanistic culture and is based on building a communication platform and aimed at rethinking the situation of endless interspecific inequality, overcoming the limitations of vocabulary, and developing ways of interacting with other species.
