The research group is an experimental fluid formation. That is part of the project (im) possible-object which was presented at the CCI "Fabrika" in July 2018 as part of the Moscow International Biennale for Young Art.

The main goal of the group is to formulate possible laws for the existence of some unknown object of the future.

In this case, the "object of the future", it is also (im) possible-object can be different for everyone. The laws could be speculative and they are not supported by a critical theory. RG tries not to generate or reproduce encyclopedic knowledge, but that want to travel on scraps of assumptions. RG is not contain a fixed number of participants and is not tied to the exact place of action.

It does not contain a fixed number of participants. The group is not tied to the exact place of action. Each new place where the participants gather is making its own contexts and features into it. Only the schedule of meetings is more or less constant, but it is also capable of updating

At WORK HARD! PLAY HARD! the online session and discussion RG "(Im) possible-object" were presented.

Speculative talk / or monologue will be devoted to systems that can destroy themselves in the quest for a perfect solution. And also periodic nullification as a (natural?) experience of existence.
