The performance comprised a collage of texts that were created by the collective last year and were hyperconnected, changed, and customized. The group was focused on the topics of Precarity, Labor, Full automation, with the performance narrative being based on two stories: a more practical one, focused on NOW and the artists' personal experience with collectivity, neoliberal critique in the post-soviet country, which fluently passed to imagination of a fully automated society. AI called ADA is speaking about new society and what she had to change. The story worked with theories of Russian Cosmism, Xenofeminism, Slovak neo-avantgarde and problematized a concept of laziness.
