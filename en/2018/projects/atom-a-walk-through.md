today, when the city has become a territory designed by urbanists and filled with crossings, benches, flowerbeds and fences, we invite you for a late-evening parkour session. our movement is be based on a game invented by Yamakasi, which is called ‘follow the leader’. in it a group of people moves in silence, following the changing leader through the streets. everyone overcomes all encountered obstacles in whatever way they can. this allows us to feel anew our own bodies in relation to space: we touch, overcome, jump, step, balance, hold, make our way through. all abilities welcome.
