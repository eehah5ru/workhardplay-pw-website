Biotechnology startups, which are focused on anti-aging solutions, are at rise in the West coast of the US, setting up the bar and vector for the development of technology for the next decades globally. But what are the ideological and philosophical implications behind this tendency, which threats and dangers can it bring? How would be the existing power structures reinforced and how will it affect different world populations? Sasha Smirnova and Vera Kavaleuskaya suggest exploring this topic in their speculative project Golden Apple Ltd., which represents a startup working with the life-extension technologies popular in the near future. They invite to imagine both a startup and a sociopolitical dimension where it may exist by reappropriating the language of contemporary advertising: specific words, speech figures, and imagery. The landing page of Golden Apple Ltd., which included promo videos and a test helping to choose a subscription plan, was available throughout the whole duration of WH!PH! in 2018.
