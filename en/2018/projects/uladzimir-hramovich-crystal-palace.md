The event took place at the waste ground in the city center, on the site of demolished building VDNKh (builded in 1968). This "Crystal palace" became an example of destruction of public spaces, spaces for exhibition and self-exposure, of opportunity to be a viewer and to be seen. The goal of the event was to retrieve this space for a short time, to make the territory visible and become visible ourselves with help of archaeological picnic. To collect the splinters, to make arrows.
