let's start moving. trying to keep each other in sight in the mirror. get along well with it. you can come close or go rather far, the main thing is that you can always see me in a mirror. and i can always see you. we will walk like this for a while. this gaze keeps us as if we stroll holding hands, but expanded into the space.

reflections can multiply reality, confuse it or, on the contrary, act as a confirmation of existence in reality of that which is reflected. this walk is just between me, you and the endless reflections. i invite you to refocus your optics and be ready to get lost in between the real and the reflected / to look through and to glance / to observe me and yourself in the reflections / to feel how the glass texture of urban modernity attracts and repulses, at the same time allows to approach and refuses entry.
