“In 1909, the entomologist Carlo Emery noted that social parasites among insects tend to be parasites of species or genera to which they are closely related. For instance, the many lineages of cuckoo bees lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees in the same family. Females of cuckoo bees do not make their own nests. Also, they lack the special long hairs which collect pollen.”

Neon Cuckoo Bee or Parasite-artist is an artistic practice-research of methods of adaptation in the art world through the concept of parasitism. Overcoming shame and fear, to penetrate into other’s statements not to level, but to use their resources for the sake of survival in the art field. The artist-parasite had a lot of plans for the WHPH!2018, she was going to be as active as possible and impudently interfere into various activities. But in fact, the Neon Bee did nothing, being constantly distressed about her unproductiveness and secretly cried. And yet, participation in the festival as a fact took place. Can we assume that the artist-parasite successfully made social and parasitic intervention?
