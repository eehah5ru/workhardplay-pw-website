We created an asemic rooms in a forest. The goal of this kind of practices is to explore collective sensibility and expose new media of communication between the asemic and nature interaction of the languages of nature and art in their closest approach. Asemic writing is by itself very close to natural phenomena that are impermanent, mutable, interdependent, ageing and dying. All in all, the point of the collective practice is to elaborate new forms of interaction.
The result could be a photo and video documentation made in 1 or 2 years, which will allow for recording of nature's impact on art.
