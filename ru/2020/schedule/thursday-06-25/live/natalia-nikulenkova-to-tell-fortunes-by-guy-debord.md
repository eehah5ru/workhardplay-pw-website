We are disoriented, confused and immersed in a situation of uncertain duration and an unknown end that may not come. The constant feeling of fatigue, the loss of a sense of time, the increasing anxiety become part of everyday life. We must observe the new rules related to social distance, which become a ritual, but are in fact an external order. We must make the choice between health and friendship, between freedom and security, but that choice has already been made for us.
When we go out into the street, we become a kind of dissident who breaks the "stay home" order.
What has changed while we were at home?
I propose that we take part in an artistic study that should rethink the new language woven into the fabric of the city. It will be a walk that every participant can take in their country, city, district.
It will be necessary to leave the house at a certain time, taking a smartphone and an external battery (power bank).
Once connected to the video conference, the participants will take turns reading the inscriptions that they will encounter on their way. This walk will be a joint poetic improvisation, which will then be deciphered and presented as text.
